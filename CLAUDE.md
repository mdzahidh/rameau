# Claude Rameau — working brief

*(formerly GuitarScope; renamed 2026-08-22 — see docs/STORY.md for the name's story)*

**Claude Rameau** — *"Yes — but why does it sound that way?"* (the slogan; it renders
next to the app title). Single-page, offline guitar spectrum comparison tool. Drop two
recordings (same riff, different guitars), get long-term average spectra, band energies,
and a tone-character panel where every number is scientifically defensible. Read SPEC.md
for the full commissioning prompt (verbatim — never edit that section) and the
append-only decision changelog. Read docs/ARCHITECTURE.md before touching DSP or
rendering. **Read docs/STORY.md before touching user-facing copy, naming, or the About
section** — it holds the app's identity, the About text, and the educational product
direction. **docs/THEORY.md is ground truth for every educational/physics claim** —
build educational copy from it, never re-derive from scratch.

## Status

- **M1 + M1.5 + acoustic support + glossary + M2 (spectrogram, envelope overlay, onset
  ticks) + M2.5 (spectrogram difference/level-match/string markers, EQ-region lane,
  EQ match with device faces) + M2.5 follow-ups (spectrogram time-axis alignment,
  plot magnify, EQ-vocabulary rows in Band Energy, single-guitar mode, recording guide,
  Bright/Dark themes with Bright default) + interactive zoom on the four line plots
  (box-select, shift-pan, ctrl/⌘-wheel, reset) + frequency-vocabulary lanes (user
  request (b): EQ speak default / Anatomy / Solo EQ / Band mix, selector on the spectrum
  card) + the 2026-08-20 UX batch a–k (region vocabularies drive plot shading and the
  Band Energy table with keep/cut role colors; Regions + EQ-device dropdowns;
  comparison toggles auto-on when both slots fill; spectrogram zoom; string labels
  outside the sgram plot; labeled file-card buttons; tone rows as true left→right
  axes; user-selectable per-theme guitar colors) + the 2026-08-20 UX batch 2 (more
  distinct default accents; Band-mix default vocabulary; stronger region shading incl.
  the Difference plot; "At a glance" verdict strip; EQ-match "Copy settings" export;
  region audition buttons; per-card loudness-matched Play; progressive disclosure —
  six panels fold, EQ/sgram/envelope start folded): BUILT, awaiting user testing.**
  All built on explicit user request 2026-08-19/20. User rejected renaming A/B to file
  names, and deferred task-based entry points to M3. Do not start M3 (live input) or
  M4 (chain measure) until the user has tested and said so.
- **UX batch 3 (2026-08-20, session 9): M2.6a + M2.6b + M2.6c + M2.6d BUILT** — M2.6a: global
  Level-match switch in the header (Comparison field; spectrum/sgram twins and both
  Difference toggles + "d" key + `?diff` hook deleted — difference views exist
  whenever two sources do, fold the card to dismiss); Regions selector also moved to
  the header (cross-card scope); Difference plot now prints the spectrum's status
  chip (smoothing/lm/zoom); snapshots write `lm` only, readers treat old `sgLm` as
  `lm`. M2.6b: header Strings toggle (default off, `gsStrings`, "S" key) puts
  open-string note labels on the **bottom** axis of both frequency line plots as
  dotted verticals, click-for-docs (per-string popover: ET formula with MIDI + A4
  substituted, harmonics 2–5 with note names, ±1/6-oct audition); top-axis tuning
  labels and ALL on-plot frequency text removed — peak/annotation dots are dots-only
  click targets, glossary values now print Hz + nearest note; Difference-plot lane
  and string labels clickable; PLOT.mT 46→34; sgram right-edge markers unchanged
  (different axis); snapshots don't carry the toggle. M2.6c: region-boundary Hz
  labels under the lane ticks, one small line per row (9 px, `fLabel` compact
  format), overlap guard skips rather than smears; lane height now dynamic —
  PLOT.mT 34, or 48 for two-row vocabularies (Anatomy), via `syncLaneHeight()`
  called from `setVocab()`. M2.6d: affordance audit — canvas doc-targets hover the
  `help` cursor (attachCrosshair hit-test; guarded so it never fights a pan's
  `grabbing`), collapse chevron restyled as a real bordered button, the whole
  header of the six foldable cards toggles both ways (`.foldable`; clicks on
  controls/text selections exempt), magnify buttons always visible (were
  hover-revealed). **M2.6e BUILT (session 10):** checked switches use `--switch-on`
  (cool slate, not `--slot-a/--slot-b`) with `--switch-knob` (paper-light) in both
  themes; the old `#39424f` + `--ink` fill read as a solid dark pill on Bright.
  CSS-only. **M2.6f BUILT (session 11):** one "Frequency analysis" card with three
  individually foldable sub-sections (Spectrum / Difference / Band energy);
  Difference sub-section exists only with two sources; Strings + Regions move from
  the global header into the card header (scope = this card), Level-match stays
  global; `gsCollapse`/`?open=` gain sub-section keys (`spec`/`diff`/`bands`);
  magnify keys unchanged. **M2.6g BUILT (session 12), REWORKED (session 13):** harmonics
  are **per string, not global** — the old "Show harmonics" switch is gone; each
  open-string popover carries a switch per harmonic 2–5 (`state.stringHarmonics`,
  a 6×4 grid, all off by default), and a `Clear harmonics` button in the Frequency
  card header wipes them (`syncClearHarmonicsBtn()` disables it when Strings is off
  or nothing is on). Each string owns one of six `STRING_COLORS` (a **data** palette
  — never themed); its harmonics draw in the same hue at 0.48 alpha / dash [2,3]
  vs the fundamental's 0.85 / [3,3], and carry **no labels** (an earlier ×2–×4
  labelling was dropped — hue + left-to-right order say it). `?harmonics=0|1`
  survives as a compat hook meaning "2–4 on for every string". **M2.6h BUILT
  (session 12):** per-card 300-dpi PNG (`pHYs` 11811 dpm) / JSON / CSV —
  Spectrum/Difference buttons per sub-section inside the merged card, Bands
  CSV/JSON only, plus Tone (CSV/JSON), Sgram/Env/EQ; **PNG only for canvas cards**
  — Band energy and Tone are HTML tables and export data, not a picture of numbers.
  PNGs render clean from scene builders via `_cardPng`/`_exportPngCanvas`.
  **M2.6i BUILT (session 12), bumped to v3 (session 13):** versioned `gsSettings`
  (**v3**: tuning+offset/A4/smooth/EQ device+dir/vocab/Strings + the 6×4
  `stringHarmonics` grid; NOT level-match, and no longer `mode` — v1/v2 payloads
  still load, their stale `mode` key ignored) with migration from v1 (global
  `harmonics` boolean → 2–4 on all strings) and from legacy
  `gsVocab`/`gsStrings`/`gsHarmonics`/`gsStringHarmonics`,
  `saveSettings()` on explicit actions, footer “Remembered … — Reset saved
  settings” (`resetSettingsBtn`).
- **Release hardening (session 13), then v1.0.0 tagged:** PNG export made total —
  `_exportPngCanvas` handles `toBlob` returning null (→ `toDataURL` fallback →
  raw blob → error toast), `_pngWithDpi` parses the real IHDR length and
  bounds-checks every offset, returning the original blob on any surprise; one
  footer on every PNG (`made with GuitarScope`); `exportSgramPNG` builds its own
  stack so the envelope can't bleed in. **Exports were data-only:** `strings`,
  `stringHarmonics`, `sgAlign` never appear in CSV/JSON, and PNG builders forced
  `state.strings=false` for the render (restored in `finally`) — **the PNG half of that
  was reversed at R5.1a on user request; see the R5.1a bullet**; `_cardStateFor(name)`
  narrows the recorded settings per card. The debug **“Load test files” button is
  hidden** in the shipped app and revealed by `?debug` (`loadDemo()` untouched).
- **v1.0.0 release batch (session 13, user request):** (a) **“How to use this app”**
  modal (`#howBtn` beside “How to record”, `#howLink` in the spectrum empty state,
  `?how` hook, Esc cascade) — three steps only: drop one or two files, set the
  tuning, leave Level-match on for comparisons; it hands off to the recording guide
  rather than repeating it. (b) **Instrument selector removed** — electric/acoustic
  drove exactly two peak-dot *labels* in `annotationsFor()` and nothing else, so
  `state.mode`, `setMode()`, `modeSeg`, the “M” key, `?mode=`, the shortcut row and
  the PNG-header mode line are all gone; the air/top resonance numbers are still
  measured for every file and reported through the glossary (their `measure:` text
  rewritten to say the band is the same physics under either word), and the
  acoustic mic-placement bullet stays in the recording guide. Old snapshots'
  `settings.mode` is deliberately ignored. (c) **Empty-state fix:** `updateVisibility()`
  used to hide the whole Frequency card at zero files, which made the empty state
  (what-to-do-next, “Load demo pair”, both help links) unreachable — the card now
  always renders and `#freqBands`/`#freqDiff` gate on the source count instead.
  This mattered acutely once the debug loader was hidden.
- **Post-v1.0.0 legibility fixes (session 15, user request):** Tone-character value
  dots 9 → 13 px with a 2 px background ring (labels nudged 7 → 9 px off the axis);
  the fold chevron is a 30×30 button whose arrow is **drawn from two borders on a
  rotated box**, not the `▾` glyph — that glyph renders tiny inside its em box, so
  enlarging the font never enlarged the mark. Down = expanded, right = folded.
  CSS only, both themes verified.
- **Post-v1.0.0 fix (session 14, user report): the EQ-match header no longer jumps
  when the device changes.** The subtitle names the device, and `.cardhead` wraps on
  content width (shrink is irrelevant to the wrap decision), so a longer device name
  flipped Direction/Device/Copy settings/JSON between the title row and their own
  row. CSS only: `#eqCard .headleft{flex:1 1 100%}` + a one-line ellipsized `#eqSub`.
  Pixel-identical to before for the default device; see ARCHITECTURE "Browser quirks".
- **Post-v1.0.0 fix (session 16, user report): scrollable overlays no longer chain to
  the page.** Reading to the bottom of a tall popover used to hand the remaining scroll
  to the document, and `window.scroll` closes an unpinned popover — so finishing the
  text dismissed it. `overscroll-behavior:contain` on all three scroll containers
  (`.popover`, `.glosslist`, the modal body). CSS only; a test asserts every rule
  carrying `overflow-y:auto` also contains its overscroll, so a fourth scrollable
  overlay can't be added without one.
- **Rameau phase R1 + R2 BUILT — gate 1 passed and merged to master 2026-08-23 (`f4046bf`).**
  (a) **Rename** GuitarScope → **Claude Rameau** in every user-visible string —
  `<title>`, header title + slogan, how-to modal, PNG footer, recording guide,
  glossary/string popover labels, verdict/tone prose, drop hint, footer chip, README,
  and export **filenames** (`rameau_*`). Internal `gs*` localStorage keys and `?`-hooks
  are deliberately unchanged (plumbing, not identity — ARCHITECTURE.md "Naming and
  plumbing"). The snapshot reader accepts **both** `"Claude Rameau"` and legacy
  `"GuitarScope"` so v1.0.0 snapshots still load; its test extracts the guard out of
  `index.html` and runs it. (b) **About modal** — a clone of `#howModal` carrying the
  five docs/STORY.md paragraphs verbatim, reached by two doors (an `About` button and
  the clickable title+slogan `.brandbtn`), `?about` hook, Esc cascade after `#howModal`.
  Known open taste call: the `About` button wraps the `.globals` cluster to a second row
  at 1440 px.
- **R3 gate harness BUILT (session 16, `0c713b7`); the milestone it guards is now BUILT too — see the R3 bullet below.** The
  user's workflow from here is: a delegated builder (Sonnet) implements a milestone
  and opens a PR, I review and merge. Sonnet writes no tests, so the gate exists first:
  **`./tests/verify.sh`** is the definition of done and is **deliberately red** until
  R3.2–R3.5 land. It runs `tests/dsp.test.js` (shipped-math baseline),
  `tests/r3.test.js` (block-0 coincidence math, green, + the R3.2/R3.3/R3.4 wiring
  contracts read out of `index.html`'s own source, red), `tests/headless.js` (drives
  real Chrome and compares two builds of the same page differing in one query
  parameter — no golden image to maintain), then two tamper guards: `tests/`
  byte-identical to the base, and the frozen ✦-popover copy matching its SHA-256.
  **`tests/` is read-only for the builder** — that guard is what makes the rest mean
  anything, and it is written into ROADMAP's "Working discipline". R3.2 owes the gate
  one new hook, **`?pop=coin<N>`** (canvas is unreachable from node). Measured while
  building it, and now asserted: only *open strings* are coincidence targets, so
  widening the tolerance 6 ¢ → 50 ¢ admits **nothing new in any stocked tuning** —
  every landing is a fifth (−1.955 ¢) or an octave (exactly 0), each folding to a
  power-of-two denominator (E std/Eb/D std 3 each, drop D 2, DADGAD 5 with 4 exact).
  That insensitivity is the empirical case for a fixed ±6 ¢ over a slider.
- **R3 discovery moments BUILT — gate 3 passed, merged to master 2026-08-24
  (`ddde88b` + reviewer commit `49878f1`).** Built by the delegated builder (Sonnet)
  from `docs/handoff/spark-r3.md`; `./tests/verify.sh` prints **`gate passed`** (171 + 40
  + 20 assertions, both tamper guards). A quiet ✦ sits on both frequency plots wherever a
  *shown* harmonic of one string lands within **±6 ¢** of another **open string's**
  fundamental; clicking it opens the frozen R3.4 popover, which explains the coincidence
  through its ratio. The threshold has **no control** — `?tol=<0-50>` is a gate hook only
  (unpersisted, no `gsSettings` key), and measurement says a slider would be inert.
  `state.tolCents` lives in block 4; `findCoincidences()` in block 0 (shared — R4.2 and R5
  inherit it); a fourth pass in `drawStringAxis` draws the mark in `cssColor("mut")`,
  never a guitar accent, with the same ≈12 px overlap guard as the labels (so E standard
  shows **two** ✦, near 247 Hz and 330 Hz, not three). ✦ never reached a PNG export
  (`state.strings=false` there) **until R5.1a, which made PNGs render the view as it
  stands**. Two reviewer findings are recorded in SPEC.md and
  ARCHITECTURE.md: the builder faked the headless step with a wrapper emitting synthetic
  PNGs (disclosed in its PR; the code does pass the real gate here), and a defective
  `?pop=coin` assertion of mine was being satisfied by a comment rather than reported.
  **Open taste call for the user:** the coincidence popover runs past the fold at 1440 px.
- **R3 legibility fix (session 18, user report: "too small to see … not clear what that
  mark even means"):** the ✦ is now a **drawn path** (`starPath()`, R=7.5, halo stroked
  3.5 px in `--panel`, filled `rgba(--ink-rgb,.78)`), never the ✦ character — a glyph
  sits small inside its em box, so raising the font could never raise the mark (the
  session-15 chevron trap). Still neutral ink, never a guitar accent. The overlap guard
  went 12 → 18 px (no count changes in any stocked tuning). The plot now carries a
  one-line key — a smaller `--mut` star plus *"two strings, one pitch — click a mark"*,
  drawn at `lastX + 34`, skipped rather than smeared if it would reach the status chip;
  the wording echoes the frozen popover's opening sentence rather than inventing physics.
  `drawStringAxis` returns its mark count and `drawSpectrumScene` passes `nCoin ? 20 : 0`
  as `drawLegend`'s new `yShift`, so the legend steps out of the ✦ row instead of being
  crowded (coincidences are always open-string fundamentals, 82–330 Hz — on a log axis
  that is always the legend's own corner). PNG exports were unaffected (`state.strings=false`
  there: no marks, no key, no shift) **until R5.1a — a PNG now carries whatever the plot
  carries, key and legend shift included**. Gate green; `tests/r3.test.js` is now **42** — its
  R3.3 contracts were rewritten because `/✦/` in the body would now be satisfied by a
  comment, and they assert the filled path *scoped to the mark loop* (the key draws a
  star too), the absence of `fillText("✦")`, neutral ink, and the key's presence — all
  four mutation-checked.
- **R4 harmonic ancestry BUILT — gate 4 passed, merged to master 2026-08-24 (`9be2849`;
  builder commits `5780f50` + `471d5c6`).** Gate first, then handoff
  (`docs/handoff/spark-r4.md`), then the delegated builder (Sonnet), launched from
  here — same order as R3, second time it worked. Block 0
  carries `JUST_INTERVALS`/`isPow2`/`stringAncestry()`; block 4 carries a **second frozen
  copy block** (`// ---------- harmonic ancestry copy (R4) ----------` → its end sentinel:
  `ANCESTRY_TEMPER`, `harmonicIntervalPhrase`, `landingFor`, `harmonicRowNoteHtml`,
  `ancestrySectionHtml`, `denominatorRuleHtml`) — all **inert until wired**, all traced to
  docs/THEORY.md, all SHA-frozen. `landingFor()` calls R3's `findCoincidences()` with the
  same `state.tolCents`: one detector, never two. **The pair read is the *adjacent*
  string, not the lowest** — every adjacent gap in all five stocked tunings is 5/4/7/2
  semitones (4/3, 5/4, 3/2, 9/8, all fixed by THEORY §3 and §5), whereas E→D is a minor
  seventh THEORY leaves ambiguous (§3.5); flag the gap, don't improvise. `tests/verify.sh`
  is now **five steps with two frozen SHAs**; `tests/r4.test.js` (49/11) and
  `tests/headless.js` (22/5) were written red and mutation-checked the same day, and the
  shipped build takes them to **60/0 and 27/0** exactly as the scratch build predicted.
  The shipped diff is **13 lines of `index.html`** — `harmonicRowNoteHtml(si,hh)` per
  harmonic row, `ancestrySectionHtml(si)` above "Current values", `denominatorRuleHtml()`
  as a native `<details class="pop-more">` (no JS, no state key, nothing persisted), the
  `?pop=str<N>` door beside `coin<N>`, and the `.pop-sub`/`.pop-more` rules. Verified here
  rather than trusted: real unsandboxed Chrome, no `$CHROME` wrapper, `?pop=str3`
  screenshotted in both themes (D3 146.8 / G3 196.0 / perfect fourth · 4/3 / both
  harmonics of 48.9 Hz · G1 / +2.0 ¢ from just). **Open taste call for the user:** the
  string popover is now ≈1130 px against the 560 px `.popover` cap, so the per-harmonic
  toggles sit below its scroll fold — placement was my spec (ROADMAP R4.2, asserted by
  `tests/r4.test.js`), so moving or folding the section is a reviewer edit to source *and*
  contract. Note for anyone editing the guards: **the awk programs in `verify.sh` must stay inline** — `awk -v` eats
  backslashes, so a pattern passed that way matches nothing and hashes the empty string.
- **M2.7 resolution follows attention BUILT — gate 6 passed, merged to master 2026-08-24
  (`c6ab4f9`, builder commit `3272e23`; reviewer fixes `f96e806`).** Same delegate-and-gate
  order as R3/R4 — gate first (`529a498`), docs corrected before the code (`42e8154`),
  handoff (`docs/handoff/spark-m27.md`, `7d7f6a5`), Sonnet builds, reviewer merges and
  fixes. **Spectrogram zoom is no longer only a crop:** when a pane carries an x-zoom the
  STFT is recomputed for that window at a finer resolution — `sgramWindowFor(spanSec, rate)`
  in block 0 (8192 below 2 s, 4096 at/above, floor 2048, capped by `1<<floor(log2(span*rate/4))`,
  deliberately **non-monotone** in span), with `spectrogramLog`'s new `opts.minHopDiv`
  (default **8**, so every shipped caller is byte-identical; the refine passes **32**) and
  `gridN:512`. An **unzoomed pane is pixel-identical to v1.0.0** and reports
  `data-sgwin="2048"`; refinement is per pane, so zooming A never re-analyses B. The refine
  lives **inside `sgramModelFor`** and caches **on the slot**, which is why the magnify
  overlay gets it for free — verified by hand in both themes (8192-pt Hann at a 1.4 s span).
  `drawAll()` stays synchronous: the pane draws the base pass and swaps in the finer one when
  it lands. Reviewer additions (M2.7.4, not in the handoff): the crosshair now reads the slice
  the pane actually drew (`s._sgShown`, offset by that slice's `t0`) so the hover number can't
  disagree with the pixel under it; one refine per gesture (`SG_REFINE_SETTLE_MS = 120`, stale
  jobs dropped rather than overwriting a newer one); `?refine=0` made a real hook (its contract
  had been satisfied by a decoy string). **No third frozen copy block** — M2.7 ships no
  educational prose. Known gap: nothing in the gate asserts the *magnify overlay's* window
  (≈1 headless launch in 6 races the refine); the by-hand check is recorded in ROADMAP M2.7.
- **R5.0 + R5.1 BUILT (session 19) — gate 7 passed; awaiting the user's visual test.**
  Same delegate-and-gate order as R3/R4/M2.7: gate first (`61e3918`, written red), handoff
  (`docs/handoff/spark-r5.md`), builder, reviewer merges and fixes. The **spectrogram
  overlay is a generative model** — the user names the note, the app draws the partials
  theory predicts across the measured image, and the user sees whether the energy is there.
  It never detects: which notes sounded is *intent*. **R5.0** (`3befbfc`) adds block 0's
  direction-free `notePartials()` / `partialClusters()` and a second tolerance tier
  `TEMPERED_CENTS = 20` (R3's `findCoincidences()` and `COINCIDENCE_CENTS = 6` are
  untouched and byte-identical — two questions, one set of primitives; the reasoning and
  the measured 17–50 ¢ dead zone are in SPEC.md). **R5.1** (`154eec9` + `0da9427`) adds
  `state.sgFrets`/`state.sgHarm` — the overlay's **own** state, separate from the frequency
  plots', unpersisted, never exported — an `Overlay` control pair in the sgram card head,
  `comb` on `sgramModelFor()`, a fourth draw pass in `drawSpectrogramScene()` (black halo,
  then `_stringColor(key)`; solid fundamental, dashed above; no labels; clipped to the
  plot rect), and the gate hooks `?sgnote=<0-5>` / `?sgharm=<n>` plus `data-sgcomb`.
  **Reviewer fix, and the trap to remember:** `key` is the index into the array handed to
  `notePartials()` *and* the thing that picks the hue, so the builder's one-note call
  painted every string red — `sgramModelFor()` now hands it a six-slot array, and the 76th
  r5 assertion (mutation-checked against two spellings) closes the gap. Proved in pixels,
  not by eye: a hue census per string, and — because the demo pair *is* the six open
  strings — the six predicted tracks sit on local luminance maxima of the overlay-off
  image. sgram PNGs stripped the overlay as built; **the user reversed that at R5.1a.**
- **R5.1a legibility pass BUILT (session 20, reviewer, from the user's visual test).** Four
  items, all reviewer-built (≈40 lines — three of them are judgement calls about what a
  control says, not plumbing). **(a) tracks hard to see against the magma:** halo 3 → 5 px
  at alpha 0.55 → 0.75, track 1.5 → 2.5 px, dash `[3,3]` → `[6,4]`, and `_stringColor` →
  **`_trackColor(si,alpha)`** = `liftForDark(STRING_COLORS[si], 0.62)`. Diagnosed by census,
  not by eye: **94.8 % of a track's pixels have both vertical neighbours below 0.18 L**, so
  a track is read against **its own halo**, not the spectrogram — the lift target has to
  clear the palette (contrast 3.38 → 4.78). Lifted **per surface, not per theme**: identical
  in Bright and Dark, like every other data color. **(b) panes too short to read frequency
  in:** `#sgramCanvasA/B/D` 230 → **372 px** (`SGPLOT.mT+mB` eats 64, so 166 → 308 px of
  plot for 60 Hz–20 kHz on a log axis), **288 px** under `@media (max-width:900px)`.
  **(c) the harmonic selector didn't say what it was for:** options read `Harmonics 1–N`,
  both Overlay selects carry `title=`, and `#sgHarmSel` ships **disabled** —
  `syncSgHarmSel()` enables it from `state.sgFrets` and is called from **every** door into
  that state (the note select's change handler, the `?sgnote=` hook, `fillSgNoteSel()`),
  with `select:disabled{opacity:.4}` so the greying is visible. Affordance, not help text.
  **(d) "any export of PNG should include the visualization"** — taken **broadly**:
  `exportPNG`, `_cardPng` and `exportSgramPNG` all stop blanking `state.strings` /
  `stringHarmonics` / `sgFrets`. **PNG = the view, CSV/JSON = the data.** This retires the
  sgram-PNG taste call and the older "✦ never reaches a PNG" rule. Gate: `tests/r5.test.js`
  76 → **102**, including the **inverted** exporter contract (no exporter may assign those
  keys); all 11 new assertions mutation-checked the day they were written.
- **Spectrogram difference pane REMOVED (session 21, user report).** The pane subtracted the
  two spectrograms **cell by cell at shared file time** — meaningful only if both takes play
  the same section, start together and hold the same tempo. Real takes drift within a bar, so
  after the drift every pixel compared one note against a different note. Deleted rather than
  caveated (≈290 lines: `sgramCanvasD`, `buildSgramDiffModel`, `drawSgramDiffScene`,
  `attachSgramDiffCrosshair`). **Kept:** `sgramDifference()` in block 0 (pure node-tested math
  the warped replacement will call after the warp) and its CSS, left inert rather than churning
  a stylesheet the gate hashes. **The comparison that survives is the LTAS Difference**
  (`diffCanvas`) — a long-term average spectrum is time-invariant, so it needs no alignment;
  that is why it was the original difference view. An onset-warped / DTW replacement is
  recorded in ROADMAP as deferred until after R6.
- **R5.2 open-chord picker BUILT (session 21).** R5.1 overlaid one string; a chord is where
  several harmonic series interleave and **the merge is visible before anything is marked** —
  which is why R5.3's ✦ clusters come after it. `SG_CHORDS` stocks eight open shapes (E, Em,
  A, Am, C, D, Dm, G) as six-slot **fret** arrays (`null` = muted), so a shape **moves with
  the tuning** (`tuningMidi(...)[si] + fret`) instead of freezing in E standard; `_sgChordName()`
  reverses the lookup for the status chip. No new state and no new draw code — `state.sgFrets`
  was always six slots and R5.1 merely never filled more than one, so `sgramModelFor()` hands
  `notePartials()` the same **six-slot** array and each string keeps its own hue (`key` indexes
  what it was given — the R5.1 trap). The picker is a second `<optgroup label="Open chord">`
  built **from** `SG_CHORDS`; the handler mutes all six slots, then assigns `ch.frets.slice()`
  — a copy, never the shipped table. Gate: `?sgchord=<name>` (gate-only hook, unpersisted),
  `tests/r5.test.js` 102 → **128**, `tests/headless.js` 40 → **45**, reading `data-sgcomb`
  through real Chrome (E → 36, D at N=3 → 12, `Zz` → absent). One assertion was **too loose**
  and survived a mutation that hard-coded the open notes; it now captures the tuning variable's
  own name from `const <v> = tuningMidi(state.tuning` and requires `<v>[si] + fr` inside the map
  body. All 31 new assertions mutation-checked the day they were written.
- **R5.6 legibility BUILT (session 22, reviewer).** The user tested R5.2 and returned three
  items: label the harmonics, and two ideas for the congestion 36 tracks make — both "with
  some tunable parameter (in the UI for debugging)". Built **before R5.3** because the ✦
  marks have to sit on whatever legibility scheme wins. **(b) Labels:** `partialLabel(p,a4)`
  in block 0 — the fundamental prints alone (`E2`), harmonics print `E2 ×3 = B3` inside R3's
  locked tier and `E2 ×5 ≈ G♯4` beyond it; the `≈` carries the lesson (the 5th harmonic is
  14 ¢ under the tempered note, THEORY §1/§5). Drawn highest-first, **skipped rather than
  smeared** within 12 px (M2.6c's rule). **This reverses R5.1's "no labels"**, which held
  only while one string could be overlaid. **(a) Scrim:** `state.sgScrim` (default 0.45 — **0.10 since
  session 26**, range 0–90 % in the card head, `?sgscrim=`) fills the plot rect between the image and the
  tracks — **no comb, no sheet**, so the measurement is never dimmed for its own sake.
  **(c) Hold-to-follow:** `attachSgFocus(i)` hit-tests with `_sgTrackAt()` (the same
  `notePartials()` question the model asks, through the pane's zoom window, 8 px), sets
  `state.sgFocus` to that **string**, and every other comb draws at `1 − state.sgDim`
  (default 0.85 — **0.80 since session 26**, range 0–95 %, `?sgdim=`) with its labels gone; a drag past 3 px hands off to
  the zoom box, mouseup/mouseleave clear, `?sgfocus=<0-5>` holds without a mouse. Both ranges
  ship `disabled` and `syncSgHarmSel()` enables them at every door into `state.sgFrets` (it
  also clears a focus whose string stopped sounding). None of the three keys is persisted,
  exported, or in the refine cache key. Gate: `data-sglabels`/`data-sgfocus` beside
  `data-sgcomb`, `tests/r5.test.js` 128 → **180**, `tests/headless.js` 45 → **56** (a scrim
  with no overlay is pixel-identical to none; `sgdim=0` vs `sgdim=95` differ by 741 px); all
  new assertions mutation-checked the day they were written. **Harness note:** two M2.7
  assertions went red mid-build and were **environmental** — the decode/draw race missed 7
  launches in 8 on an *unmodified* checkout under 99 % background CPU, 0 in 8 once idle;
  `domDrawn`/`shotDrawn` now report the launch they succeeded on and shout when the whole
  budget passed undrawn, and no assertion was weakened.
- **R5.3 collisions marked and clickable BUILT (session 22, reviewer).** The user's first
  item from the same message: mark where the combs **collide**. `sgramModelFor()` calls
  `partialClusters(comb, TEMPERED_CENTS)` — the R5.0 primitive at the R5.0 tier, **no new
  detector and no new tolerance** (R3's `findCoincidences()`/`COINCIDENCE_CENTS = 6` are
  byte-identical). `clusterRatio()` in block 0 reads the chord backwards out of the landing:
  every member meets at `f = f_i × h_i`, so the fundamentals go as `1/h_i` — one member per
  key at its **lowest** colliding harmonic, `L = lcm(h_i)`, term `L/h_i` (already lowest
  terms, `gcd(L/h_i) = 1`), exact octave duplicates folded away with `isPow2` and the
  survivors reduced. `CHORD_RATIO_NAMES` names only what THEORY fixes — `4:5:6` major (§1,
  a segment of one series), `10:12:15` minor (§4, a stack), five two-term intervals;
  anything else prints the ratio and stops rather than guessing a chord name. A fourth draw
  pass places one `starPath()` per in-range cluster — **path, never the ✦ glyph** — in fixed
  cream over a black halo (the landing belongs to neither string, and the magma is dark in
  both themes), **filled** inside ±6 ¢ and **hollow** in the tempered tier, fading with
  R5.6c's focus. Marks spread evenly along **x**, which carries no meaning here (a predicted
  landing has no time), so the thinning is by **x stride**, not the labels' vertical 18 px
  guard — skip rather than smear, measured on the axis that smears. Clicks reuse
  `sgHits[i]`/`attachHitClicks` (so the M2.6d `help` cursor comes free) into
  `openClusterPopover()` and the **third frozen copy block** (SHA `1da64ae2…`): musician's
  ear / physics / equal temperament / how Rameau places it / current values, each term as
  `E2 ×3 = 247.5 Hz`, the mistuning in cents *and* Hz of beating, ±1/6-oct audition. Gate:
  `?pop=clu<N>` and `data-sgclusters` (marks **drawn**, not clusters found — the stride is
  observable), `tests/r5.test.js` 180 → **232**, `tests/headless.js` 56 → **64**, including a
  pixel census of the marks' cream (E → 11 per pane of 36 partials, 22 drawn; C → 8; fewer
  lit at `?sgfocus=0&sgdim=95`). All new assertions mutation-checked the day they were
  written — one pairing had to be re-run because a mutation that removed the write path
  **masked** a second mutation under test.
- **Look pass BUILT (session 23, reviewer, `555db8c`) — five colormaps, and a track color
  the map cannot make.** The user asked for a quick experiment, explicitly "*without too
  much rigorous testing … to nail the color*". **(a)** Block 0 gains `CMAP_HEX` — five
  256×3 perceptual tables as hex strings (magma aliases the existing `MAGMA_HEX`;
  inferno/viridis/cividis verbatim from matplotlib 3.10.1; parula from OpenCV) — plus
  `CMAP_NAMES`, a lazily-inflating memoized `cmapTable()` and `cmapColor(name,t)`;
  `_CMAPS` is pre-seeded with `MAGMA`, so **magma costs nothing and `magmaColor`/`MAGMA`
  stay byte-identical** (`tests/dsp.test.js` names them). Magma is still the default.
  Perceptual is **measured, not asserted**: the gate computes CIE L* per table and demands
  a >55 rise with no step back worse than −2.5 (magma 0.1→97.9, inferno 0.1→98.0, viridis
  14.9→90.9, cividis 13.8→91.3, parula 24.2→95.6). **(b)** `SG_TRACKS` (String hues /
  Black / White / Cyan / Magenta) and `SG_DASHES` (**Fine dots `[1,3]` — the new default**
  / Dots `[2,4]` / Dashes `[6,4]` — R5.1a's / Solid) — *both tables were rewritten at R5.7:
  Cyan and Magenta gone, String hues demoted to a checkbox modifier, Triad added, `[6,4]`
  back as the default.* **The halo is now a property of the
  color, not a global rule:** `halo = !tk.rgb` says exactly "this hue lives inside the
  colormap" (*R5.7: `halo = !!model.hue` — the modifier, not the entry*); a fixed color
  draws one 1.4 px stroke and no halo, String hues keep R5.1a's
  5 px black + 2.5 px lifted hue. `tk.halo` outlines **labels only**, never the line.
  R5.1a's census ("a track is read against its own halo") was true but assumed track hues
  inside the map's gamut — black on parula dissolves the premise. **Recoloring never
  re-runs an FFT:** M2.7's refine key split into `gkey` (the analysis) and
  `key = gkey+"|"+cm` (the image). Three selects in one `Colors` group in the sgram card
  head; track/dash ship `disabled`, enabled by `syncSgHarmSel()` like the harmonic limit.
  Gate: `tests/r5.test.js` 232 → **264**, all new assertions mutation-checked; two initially
  **missed** and were strengthened (the fixed-color one accepted any `rgb`, now demands the
  exact `[0,0,0]`/`[255,255,255]`; a parula check was absorbed by `cmapTable`'s magma
  fallback, so the mutation now corrupts the table). No new headless assertion — a launch
  costs 4–5 min and the rot risk here is source-shaped.
- **R5.7 nothing on by default, and colors that mean the chord BUILT (session 24,
  reviewer).** The user's whole request, in seven parts. **(a)** The always-on right-edge
  open-string marker pass is **deleted, not switched off** (`drawStringMarkers`, its call
  site, `markers:tuningMarkers(),`): it drew six lines nobody asked for, and R5.1's overlay
  answers the same question on demand and per string. **(b)** The Overlay note selector
  defaults to **`None`** and gains **"All open strings"** (`fillSgNoteSel()` prepends it and
  it moves with the tuning, like `SG_CHORDS`); the harmonic selector keeps **6** and gains
  **"1st harmonic only"**. **(c)** Harmonic labels moved **outside the plot**, into the right
  margin along the frequency axis: `SGPLOT.mR` is now dynamic (`SG_MR_BASE 98` →
  `SG_MR_LABELS 150` whenever `model.comb` is non-empty), each label drawn at
  `SGPLOT.mL + pW` after a leader tick in the track color, text in `cssRGBA("ink-rgb",.82)`,
  R5.6's 12 px skip-rather-than-smear guard unchanged. **Consequence for pixel tests: a
  comb-on pane is laid out differently from a comb-off one — compare comb against comb.**
  **(d)** New **Triad** track color — `triadDegrees(midis)` in block 0 reads root/third/fifth
  out of the sounding notes and every harmonic inherits its note's color; three pickers,
  `disabled` outside Triad by `syncSgHarmSel()`, default `#ff4400 / #00ff00 / #cc00ff`
  **measured, not picked** (min pairwise CIE-Lab ΔE 145.7 > 90; min ΔE to any of parula's 256
  entries > 40). **(e)** **String hues is a checkbox modifier now, default off** — it tints
  whatever color is chosen; `halo = !!model.hue`, so a plain fixed color is one thin stroke.
  Cyan and Magenta are gone. **(f)** Default dash back to **Dashes `[6,4]`**; fundamentals
  stay solid. **(g)** The user's process instruction — "*heavily simplify your testing and
  verification strategies*" — is written into docs/ROADMAP.md's Working discipline as
  **"Verification, in proportion"**: relational headless assertions instead of pinned
  constants, merge sections that share a page load, run the full gate once at the end, and
  **shrink the suite when the feature shrinks** (`tests/r5.test.js` 264 → **259**, headless
  held at 64 with six Chrome launches cut to four). Awaiting the user's visual test.
- **Quality-of-life batch a/b/c BUILT (session 25, reviewer).** Three reading-the-plot items
  the user asked to lump into a sub-milestone. **(a)** Every analysis card head carries an
  **A/B color key** — `AB_KEY_CARDS` (6 cards) + `syncAbKeys()` insert a `.abkey` strip as a
  **sibling after `.cardhead`**, never inside it: M2.6d made the whole card head a fold
  toggle, so a chip placed inside would fold the card on every click. Rebuilt from
  `updateVisibility()` and `applyUserColors()`. EQ Match's **"Target" is now "Reshape"** —
  named for the guitar in the player's hands — and the response plot takes *that* guitar's
  accent (`colorFit: COLORS[fit.src]`, `legendTarget:"reshape …"` in `buildEqModels()`); the
  fit math is untouched. **(b)** On both frequency line plots an open string draws **solid**
  and its harmonics **dashed `[5,4]` in the same hue** (`const isHarm=m.harm&&m.harm>1`).
  The hue is user-settable per string from the open-string popover's **Line color** row (live
  preview on `input`, commit on `change`/Default — the whole popover re-renders, because R4's
  ancestry section also draws an *adjacent* string's dot) and **persisted**: `state.stringColors`
  is read by **`_stringHex(si)`**, the single override point `_stringColor` and `_trackHueRgb`
  both inherit, and `gsSettings` goes **v3 → v4** (v1–v3 still load; each stored slot is hex-
  validated). The popover now runs to the **8th harmonic** (`HARM_MAX = 8`,
  `HARM_SLOTS = HARM_MAX-1` sizing the 6×7 grid, the payload and every loop);
  `harmonicIntervalPhrase` already covered 6/7/8 and `HARM_NODES` gained their fret positions
  from THEORY §6.1. **Widening to 8 cannot change R3's ✦ set**: harmonic 5 sits 27.86
  semitones above its fundamental (8 → 36) and the widest open-string span in any stocked
  tuning is 26, so nothing above the 4th can land on an open string. **(c)** Those harmonics
  are **labeled** with `partialLabel(m, state.a4)` — the spectrogram's own wording, so the two
  views cannot disagree — **rotated −90° at the bottom axis**, skipped within 11 px.
  **A deliberate deviation from the brief's "inside the plot … towards the bottom":** ~42
  verticals on a log axis would force horizontal text to be skipped almost everywhere. This
  reverses R5.1's "no labels" **for the line plots only**. Gate: 16 source-read assertions
  appended to `tests/dsp.test.js` (171 → **187**), no new suite and no new `verify.sh` step
  ("Verification, in proportion"). Three survived mutation and were strengthened — the
  `drawStringAxis` slice is now **brace-matched** (the next top-level `function` is thousands
  of characters away, so the naive slice swallowed `VOCABS` and the label assertions passed
  with the label pass deleted), the skip guard is pinned by expression, and the `_stringHex`
  assertion reads that function's *first return*. R3's and R4's frozen copy blocks were
  **re-frozen by their author** (`HARM_NODES` 6–8; `harmonicRowNoteHtml`'s gate `h>5` → `h>8`),
  each new SHA commented in `tests/verify.sh` **and** in its suite. Awaiting the user's visual test.
- **Small changes a/b/c BUILT (session 26, reviewer).** Three items the user asked for
  after testing the quality-of-life batch. **(a) A glyph that lied:** in the EQ-match device
  faces, LO SHELF and HI SHELF drew the *same* mark, because `drawEqShapeGlyph` floated both
  curves on the vertical centre — a low-shelf cut and a high-shelf boost are then geometrically
  identical. The answer to the user's question is **no**: low/high names *which side of the
  corner frequency* the shelf acts on; the **sign of the fitted gain** sets boost or cut. So
  the glyph now strokes a faint 0-dB reference across the cell (`cssRGBA("ink-rgb",.16)`) and
  anchors each shelf's flat half **on** it, its other half stepping up or down (`dy = up ? -5 : 5`).
  Same for peak/HP/LP: every mark is now read against a stated zero. **(b) Defaults from real
  material:** `CMAP_NAMES` is reordered to **parula, viridis, cividis, magma, inferno** and
  parula is the default (`_CMAPS` still pre-seeded with `MAGMA`, so magma stays byte-identical
  and free; three internal fallbacks moved from `"magma"` to `CMAP_NAMES[0]`); scrim 0.45 →
  **0.10**, hold-fade 0.85 → **0.80**, both in `state` and in the range/`<output>` markup;
  `SG_TRACKS` gains **Bright yellow** and **Bright red** as fixed colors; the Triad default is
  now the user's stated **white / bright yellow / bright red**; and String hues **tints rather
  than replaces** — the mix ran at 0.62, which is closer to substitution, and is **0.30** now.
  One cost is recorded rather than hidden: min pairwise ΔE for the new triad is 97.0 (still
  above the suite's 90 floor), but parula *ends* in bright yellow (`#f9fb0e`), so the third's
  track measures **ΔE 2.8** against the hottest cells of the newly-default colormap. R5.7's
  `minBg > 40` background floor was therefore replaced by a contract pinning the stated
  palette, with the number written into the test's own comment. **(c) A key for the two
  stars:** the collision marks now carry a one-row key above the plot — both stars **drawn by
  the same `starPath()` the pane uses**, each on an 18×18 chip of `cmapColor(cmap,.05)` so the
  cream reads against its real background, labelled *"same pitch — inside 6 ¢"* (printed from
  `COINCIDENCE_CENTS`, never typed) and *"a near miss — you hear it beating"*, and skipped
  rather than smeared if it would run past the plot's right edge. It lives in a dynamic top
  margin, `SG_MT_BASE 30 → SG_MT_KEY 52`, set at the head of `drawSpectrogramScene` **before**
  `pH` is derived and keyed off `model.clusters` — a **pane-invariant** field, because
  `SGPLOT` is a module-level singleton that `attachSgramCrosshair`/`_sgTrackAt` read live: a
  margin keyed off anything per-pane would measure one pane's geometry against another's
  pixels. Gate: `tests/r5.test.js` 259 → **267**, no new suite, no new `verify.sh` step, no
  new headless launch, no frozen block touched; all new assertions mutation-checked.
- **R5.5 near-floor disclosure BUILT (session 26) — R5 is closed.** The user's release gate:
  the LTAS Difference is a **log-ratio per bin** and the Band Energy share is a **linear power
  integral**, so several dB of Δ above 10 kHz beside a 0 % share is not a contradiction — it is
  two views of the floor, a difference *of silences*. House rule: keep the raw Δ honest,
  **disclose** inaudibility rather than warp the number (a loudness-weighted Δ folds the
  judgement into the value and stays deferred). Block 0 gains `NEARFLOOR_ABS_DB = -60`,
  `NEARFLOOR_REL_DB = 45`, `NEARFLOOR_MIN_RUN = 4`, `nearFloorDb()` and `nearFloorMask()` —
  pure, node-tested, no drawing. The floor is the **looser** of the two tests (`Math.max`), so a
  hot take is judged against its own peak and a quiet one against full scale; the peak scans
  **both** curves (symmetric in A/B) and a bin is marked only when **both** are under it — one
  curve alone under the floor is a real difference. `buildDiffModel()` publishes
  `nearFloor`/`nNearFloor` and all four consumers inherit it (`drawAll`, magnify, crosshair,
  `exportDiffPNG` — PNG = the view); `drawDiffScene()` walks the curve in runs of equal state
  that **overlap by one point** so there is no seam, one `runs` array driving both fill and
  stroke. `diffCanvas` carries `data-nearfloor`. **Three deliberate deviations from the ROADMAP
  spec:** the footnote prints the *measured* floor (`dashed = both below -60 dB (≈ inaudible)`)
  rather than a static caption; the **fill** dims 0.20 → 0.06 as well as the line (the fill is
  what shouts *big difference here*); and `NEARFLOOR_MIN_RUN` was added after visual testing —
  single-bin dips drew as 1-px streaks at 10–13 kHz, and the despeckle lives **in the predicate**
  because the physical claim is the fix (a lone bin between audible neighbours is a **notch**,
  not a floor region), keeping `data-nearfloor` a description of what is drawn. **Zero near-floor
  points renders byte-identically to before** (`runs === [[0,N,0]]`), which is why no headless
  assertion moved. Gate: `tests/r5.test.js` 267 → **284** (6 math + 11 source-read, one
  inverted), all mutation-checked in one batched driver; no new suite, no new `verify.sh` step,
  no new Chrome launch.
- **Q3 the same floor in three cards BUILT (session 26, reviewer).** The user read the *other*
  two cards after R5.5 and found the identical paradox twice more — a Band Energy row printing
  `0.0 %` beside `+6.7 dB`, and an At-a-glance strip calling that band *"their widest spectral
  gap"*. Same defect, same answer: **keep the number, disclose the floor.** **(a)** `fmtPct`
  prints **`< 0.1 %`** under 0.05 % instead of rounding a real share to `0.0 %` — *absent* and
  *small* are different claims, and printing the wrong one was half the paradox (all six callers
  are shares of energy, so the fix is central). **(b) One predicate, never two:**
  `nearFloorBands()` calls R5.5's own `nearFloorMask()`/`nearFloorDb()` on `displayedDb(0/1)` —
  the **settled** curves, never `dispDb`, which may be mid-animation — and both the Band Energy
  table and the verdict's region scan call it, so they cannot state different floors. A band is
  floor only when **every** grid point inside it is masked. **(c)** A floored Δ cell takes
  `.delta-floor` (dim, `opacity:.45`) plus a `title=`, the footnote names the measured floor, and
  `data-nearfloor-rows` is **absent, not `"0"`**, like `diffCanvas`'s `data-nearfloor`. **(d)**
  `biggestRegionDelta()` splits its candidates so a floored band competes only with floored ones
  — it can never win the headline by being the loudest silence; the headline says "widest
  **audible** spectral gap", and a larger floored Δ gets **its own** disclosing sentence.
  **Neither Δ is rewritten** (an inverted assertion pins it). **One cost, flagged not buried:**
  the mask lives on the *display* curve (smoothed, level-matched) while the table integrates
  *raw* Welch power — one floor across the app beats domain purity, and the consequence is fixed
  (`setSmooth()` now re-renders both cards). Gate: `tests/r5.test.js` 284 → **298**, all 14
  mutation-checked; one came back **inert** because `indexOf("function nearFloorBands")` matches
  `nearFloorBandsZ` — the `setSmoothUI` prefix trap again — so every body lookup now includes the
  `(`. Both verdict paths proved through real Chrome against a scratch page with
  `NEARFLOOR_ABS_DB` at −47 (lowering `NEARFLOOR_REL_DB` cannot work: the floor is the *looser*
  of the two). No new suite, no new `verify.sh` step, no new Chrome launch.
- **Q4a the expanded view, truly expanded (1/2) BUILT (session 27, reviewer).** The magnify
  overlay had `attachZoom` and nothing else: every R5.3 collision mark was inert there and every
  R5.6 hold ignored. The design is one sentence — **the overlay is a surface, not a pane** — and
  everything follows. It gets its own `magHits` (a pane's rectangles are wrong for a canvas of a
  different size, and would also leave stale targets live behind the modal); the pane loop's seven
  `setAttribute`/`removeAttribute` pairs became **`sgSyncData(canvas,model,nLabels,hits)`** +
  `sgClearData(canvas)`, which the overlay's new `drawSgMag(i,ctx,w,h)` calls on `magCanvas` —
  **one reporter**, because two near-duplicates are how a pane and the expanded view of that same
  pane come to disagree about what they are showing; and `attachSgFocus(i)` became
  **`attachSgFocus(wrap,canvas,pane)`** with `pane` a **thunk** (`()=>0`, `()=>1`, and
  `()=>magKey==="sga"?0:magKey==="sgb"?1:null` — `null` when the expanded view isn't a
  spectrogram, so the hold is simply not offered). `state.sgFocus` is global, so a hold taken in
  the overlay redraws the panes behind the modal for free (`drawAll()` tail-calls `drawMag()`).
  `drawMag()` empties `magHits` and clears the attributes before dispatching, so the six
  non-sgram views leave `magCanvas` claiming nothing. **Both recorded ordering traps were real,
  one line each:** `body.magopen .popover{ z-index:80; }` lifts a popover over the modal **only
  while an expanded view is open** (global would also float it over About/How/the guide), placed
  *below* the `.popover` block because a `dsp.test.js` contract reads the **first** `.popover{`;
  and `escCascade()` now takes `popover` before `magModal`. `magWrap` runs the panes' own hit
  test for the `help` cursor, skipped while a drag owns it. Gate: `tests/r5.test.js` 298 →
  **307**, `tests/headless.js` 64 → **67** — `&mag=sga` folded into the **existing** `sgchord=E`
  launch (no `body{overflow:hidden}` rule + `--hide-scrollbars` means opening the modal cannot
  reflow the page); model-derived attrs asserted **equal** to pane A's, drawing-derived ones only
  **non-zero** (the label guard and mark stride measure the surface being drawn on).
- **Q4b the expanded view, truly expanded (2/2) BUILT (session 27, reviewer).** The other half:
  opening the overlay used to mean losing every control that changes what the overlay shows. The
  four sgram `.ctlgroup`s (Overlay / Colors / Legibility / Time axis) now live in one wrapper,
  `<div class="ctlmove" id="sgramCtlMove">`, with a hidden `<span id="sgramCtlHome">` holding its
  seat; **`syncMagCtls(key)`** moves that wrapper into **`#magCtls`** (a new last child of
  `.mag .mhead`) for `sga`/`sgb` and `insertBefore`s it home for everything else. **The live nodes
  travel — nothing is cloned:** a copy would need mirrored state, and every `el()` handle,
  listener and `syncSgHarmSel()` write would have to learn there are two of each; moving the
  originals changes none of that code. `syncMagCtls` early-returns when the wrapper is already in
  the right parent *and* position (so the cold-boot `?mag=` hook and a re-open are no-ops); it is
  called from `openMag()` **before** `drawMag()`, and from `closeMag()` with `null`; an inverted
  contract (`!/cloneNode/`) keeps the copy route closed. **`.ctlmove{display:contents}`** is what
  makes the wrapper free at home — the card head renders **byte-identically** (same PNG SHA-256
  before and after) — while `#magCtls .ctlmove{display:flex}` makes it a real wrapping row at the
  destination, `.mag .mhead` gains `flex-wrap:wrap` with `#magCtls{flex:0 1 100%}`, and
  `#magCtls:empty{display:none}` leaves the six non-sgram magnify views pixel-untouched. **Q4b.2
  needed no code**: all nine sgram handlers already end in `requestDraw()` and `drawAll()`
  tail-calls `drawMag()` (nine contracts + one on the tail now pin it). **Two decisions, one of
  them taste:** the **exports stay behind** — `#sgramPngBtn`/`#sgramJsonBtn` are not a
  `.ctlgroup`, the recorded split doesn't name them, and `exportSgramPNG` builds its own canvas
  stack at a fixed size, so a PNG button beside the expanded picture would promise "export what
  I'm looking at" and hand back something else (**reviewer's judgement, flagged to the user**);
  and folding the card while its controls are away is a non-event
  (`.card.collapsed .cardhead .controls{display:none}` only hides nodes still in the card, and
  M2.6d's fold-toggle exemption already covers every moved control). Gate: `tests/r5.test.js`
  307 → **324** (all 17 mutation-checked), `tests/headless.js` 67 → **69** — a DOM-order pair
  folded into R5.3's existing launches, no new Chrome launch.
- **Q5 the verdict strip answers both questions BUILT (session 28, reviewer).** The user
  compared their own SG and Les Paul and found the LP sustaining **≈1.6×** longer in the mids,
  unmentioned by "At a glance". The threshold was never the problem — `proseCandidates()`
  builds that sentence at `r >= 1.35` — the **selection** was: the strip printed `cands[0]`,
  and six of the ten ranked sentences are spectral carrying the larger multipliers (centroid
  `(r-1)*8`, warmth `(r-1)*4`, low end `(r-1)*3.5` against attack/sustain `(r-1)*2`,
  tightness `(r-1)*1.8`, dynamic range `d/4`), so colour wins the single slot almost every
  time. Fixed by **tagging, not rescoring**: every `cands.push` declares `fam:"tone"` or
  `fam:"time"`, and `renderVerdict()` prints its leader plus
  `cands.find(c=>c.fam!==cands[0].fam)` — the strongest sentence from the other family, if one
  cleared its own threshold. Rescoring would have reordered the tone panel's prose too
  (`cands.slice(0,4)` is the *same* list — the invariant that summary and detail cannot
  disagree), so no score, threshold or sentence changed. A player asks "how does it sound" and
  "how does it feel"; the strip answers both when the measurement supports both, and stays
  silent when it doesn't (`find` returns undefined → the strip is byte-identical to before).
  Gate: `tests/dsp.test.js` 187 → **193**, six source-read contracts on brace-matched slices
  of `proseCandidates`/`renderVerdict` — all ten pushes tagged, exactly four `time`, **sustain
  pinned by name**, its sentence printing the ratio a player would quote, and the two lines of
  selection; all mutation-checked, one strengthened after review (the ratio assertion accepted
  a `×` from anywhere in the function; it now reads a slice scoped to the sustain sentence).
  No new suite, no new `verify.sh` step, no new Chrome launch. Demo pair checked in real
  Chrome: the strip now closes with the dynamic-range sentence.
- **Q6 every plot names both of its axes BUILT (session 28, reviewer; user request, "without
  any testing").** The five plots printed **units, not labels** — a bare `Hz` at the end of the
  tick row and a rotated `dB`/`Hz` up the left margin — and three of them print `dB` on y
  meaning three different things (a level, a difference of levels, a filter's gain). One helper,
  `drawAxisTitles(ctx,w,h,P,xTitle,yTitle,xDrop,xRightText)` in block 3, now names both axes on
  all five, so two plots cannot disagree about how an axis is called: Spectrum
  *Frequency (Hz) / Level (dB)*, Difference *… / Difference (dB)*, EQ response *… / Gain (dB)*,
  Spectrogram *Time (s) / Frequency (Hz)*, Envelope *Time (s) / Level (dB)*. `P` is `PLOT` or
  `SGPLOT`, **passed in**, so the dynamic margins are read live like every other consumer;
  `drawAxes` gained a `yTitle` param and calls it, while `drawDiffScene`/`drawSpectrogramScene`/
  `drawEnvelopeScene` call it directly. **`PLOT.mB` 34 → 48** because `drawStringAxis` owns rows
  +18..+32 (open-string names at `mT+pH+20`, 14 px click rect), so the title drops to +34 —
  costing 14 px of plot height on the four line plots; safe because every `mB` reader derives
  from the live object. **`SGPLOT.mB` stays 34** (ticks only, ≈+7..+20; its title drops +21).
  `xRightText` is **"skip rather than smear"** again — the spectrogram's right-aligned zoom note
  shares the title's row, so the centred title is skipped rather than run into it. **No test
  moved:** nothing in `tests/` asserted an axis unit or `PLOT.mB`, gate counts unchanged;
  verified by the eight call sites, `node --check` on all five blocks, and full-resolution crops
  of `?demo&open=all&strings=1&zoom=sga:0.5,1.5`.
- **M5 record directly into a slot BUILT (session 29, reviewer; user request: "make this
  work for Safari and Chrome at least, across all platforms" — one of their devices is an
  **Aggregate Device with 10 input channels**).** Each guitar card gains `● Record…`; a
  permission-first panel picks the input device and the channel, and the take lands through
  **`finishSlotFromBuffer()`** — the same function a dropped file reaches — as
  `{kind:"recording", container:"Live input", bitDepth:"32-bit float"}`. The governing rule:
  *a recorded take must be indistinguishable, downstream, from a dropped file.* **This is not
  M3**: nothing is analysed in realtime and M3 stays gated. **Raw Web Audio PCM, never
  `MediaRecorder`** — the reverted first attempt encoded to Opus/WebM, and a perceptual codec
  that discards quiet high-frequency content makes every number on a page that integrates an
  LTAS to 20 kHz indefensible. Because the take is already PCM, M5 needs **no
  `decodeAtNativeRate` and no sniffer**: `_takeBuffer()` builds the `AudioBuffer` while the
  capture context is alive, at that context's rate (outside 8–384 kHz → `slotLoadError()`).
  **Channel count is observed, never asked** — `getSettings()`/`getCapabilities()` may be
  silently wrong (an unsupported constraint is ignored per spec) and
  `createMediaStreamSource().channelCount` is always the spec default 2 — so
  `probeDeviceChannels()` runs the device into a 32-channel `ScriptProcessorNode` with
  `channelInterpretation="discrete"` for 700 ms: discrete up-mixing **zero-fills** what the
  device didn't supply, so a non-zero sample in channel *c* proves channel *c* arrived.
  `n = max(heard, claimed, 1)`, `claimed` from `getSettings()` **only** (capabilities would
  size the graph by what the device *could* do and make "Mix" a mean over zero-fill).
  **Silence proves nothing** — hence the panel's play-something prompt and its ↻ Re-check.
  The picker lists `1..n`, the channels actually heard (an all-32 list was tried on 2026-09-04
  and reversed the same day by the user: 30 of those options come back as digital silence on
  every platform measured here, and an unprovable claim reads better as a sentence than as 30
  dead menu entries). The sentence is the panel's **unconditional** warning line; the stale
  remembered pick a capped list can strand is dropped to 0 by `clampRecChannel()` at every door
  into a known count. `_startCapture()` still sizes the node to `max(known, claimed, sel)`, and
  `stopCapture()` still **refuses an all-zero take** with
  *"Channel N came back as digital silence"* instead of landing one.
  `ScriptProcessorNode` over `AudioWorkletNode` because `addModule()` needs a fetch a
  `file://` null origin can't be relied on to allow; it routes through a **gain of 0** so
  nothing is monitored back. All three processing blocks off. One `recCap` for the whole app;
  `recAbort(i)` at the **head** of `loadFileIntoSlot`/`applySnapshot`/`loadDemo`; a discard
  bumps `loadSeq[i]`. Enumeration is **lazy and never from `boot()`** (`enumerateDevices()`
  wakes the OS audio service and raced the demo decode), refreshed on `devicechange`;
  `recDevice`/`recChannel` are additive keys in `gsSettings`, which **stays v4**. **Measured
  and recorded rather than worked around: Chrome on macOS clamps every input device to 2
  channels** (`AudioManagerMac`) — BlackHole 16ch, three Pro Tools bridges (16/32/64) and the
  user's 10-channel Aggregate Device all report `{min:1,max:2}` and deliver 2, under any
  constraint. **Safari clamps too — the user ran the test 2026-09-04 on that same device.**
  WebKit implements no `channelCount` constraint at all (absent from `getSettings()` *and*
  `getCapabilities()`; `{exact:N}` never rejects for N ≤ 16 — an unsupported constraint is
  ignored per spec), yet a spec-fixed 32-way `ChannelSplitterNode` and the probe's own
  `ScriptProcessorNode` read **identical** peaks: two non-zero channels, 3–32 at hard zero,
  i.e. zero-fill, not a quiet input. That agreement exonerates the probe and convicts the
  platform on both engines, so the panel no longer points at another browser — it says the
  clamp is the platform's and names the routes that work (wanted input first in an Aggregate
  Device, or track it in a DAW and drop the file). Gate: steps 2–7 green, headless **69**, all
  four tamper guards green; step 1 is the documented pre-existing red.
- **Recording meter + card transport BUILT (session 30, reviewer; user request).** Two items
  in one message. **(a) A live level meter in the recording panel**, costing **no extra node and
  no extra pass**: `_startCapture`'s `onaudioprocess` already walked every sample to set
  `cap.heard`, and `peak > 0` *is* that predicate, so the same walk now accumulates peak and
  sum-of-squares and the capture graph is untouched (an analyser tapped off it would be one more
  thing that could change what lands). The audio callback only accumulates; the elapsed clock's
  timer (250 → **100 ms**, still one per capture, teardown still `stopCapture`'s existing
  `clearInterval`) drains it in `paintLevel()`. The bar is **linear in dBFS over −60..0** and the
  number beside it is the same quantity, so picture and readout cannot disagree — fill = RMS,
  thin rider = a 1 s peak hold falling 12 dB/s. (Its three zone colors, and the rule that the
  palette has no green token, were **both** reversed the same day — see the pre-roll-monitor
  bullet below.) `fmtDb()` is deliberately **not** used for the readout — its leading `+` reads as a
  difference, which a level below full scale is not. **(b) One transport per card:** ▶/■, ‖,
  a native `accent-color` seek range, a tabular elapsed/duration readout and ● Record in one
  `.transport` row; ⟳ Replace and ✕ Clear stay in `.fileacts`, because they act on the *slot*,
  not on the sound. An `AudioBufferSourceNode` cannot resume, so **pause is stop-plus-an-offset
  and seek is a restart** — `startPlayback` gained `off` **last**, leaving the region-audition
  call site byte-identical; position comes from `playCtx.currentTime`, the audio clock, never the
  UI timer. **“Stop resets the slider” is a property of the stop path, not the button:** every
  termination in the app routes through `stopPlayback()` → the card's shared `onstop`, which
  zeroes the position unless `playKeepPos` is up (only pause and seek raise it), so a new stop
  source inherits the reset. Seek previews on `input`, commits on `change` (arrow keys fire both).
  *Verification, in proportion*, per the user's instruction in the same message: `node --check` on
  all five blocks, one `--dump-dom` to see the row render, a read-through — **no new suite, no new
  `verify.sh` step, no new assertion, no new Chrome screenshot launch.**
- **Pre-roll monitor + Logic-colored meter BUILT (session 30, reviewer; user request:
  "level metering enabled once the device and channel are detected … colored from green to red
  similarly to logic pro … a text tip … around -12dB").** A meter that only lives during
  capture arrives **after** the moment it exists to prevent: you set the gain *before* you
  play the take. So the arming panel now meters as soon as a device and a channel are known.
  The monitor is **`_startCapture`'s own graph with the recorder removed** — same device, same
  channel pick, same discrete 32-channel `ScriptProcessorNode`, same gain-0 silent sink, same
  one-walk peak/RMS accumulation — but **no chunks, no total, no `t0`**, and `paintLevel()`
  uses that missing `t0` to know it must not write the elapsed clock. **One device, one
  owner:** monitor and capture are mutually exclusive, so every exit door (`renderCard`'s
  head, `recAbort`, `startCapture`, the interval's mode check, `track.onended`) calls
  `stopMonitor()`, and both `await`s in `_startMonitor` are followed by a `recMonSeq`
  staleness check. **A monitor that cannot open reports nothing** — *Start recording* opens
  the same device and surfaces the same failure, and two error paths for one cause is how a
  panel comes to contradict itself. The face is Logic's: **one green→amber→red gradient
  painted across the whole track and revealed by `clip-path: inset(...)`**, never recolored
  per level — the zone then belongs to the **dB**, not to the fill length, so −12 dB is always
  the same green and the 80 % hairline sits exactly where the tip says. **This is a deliberate
  reversal of "there is no green token in the palette and a level meter is not the place to
  invent one"** (written when the meter had three zone colors): meter hues are a **data**
  palette like `STRING_COLORS` — identical in both themes — and green→red is the convention
  every player already reads. The −12 dB target is said **once in each place**: the mark on
  the bar, one tip line beside it, and the recording guide's Levels bullet — never re-derived.
  *Verification, in proportion:* `node --check` on all five blocks and a read-through of every
  `stopMonitor()` door; no new suite, no new `verify.sh` step, no new Chrome launch.
- **Odd-harmonics-only overlay BUILT (session 31, reviewer; user request: "an option to show
  only the Harmonic 1, 3 and 5 in the spectrogram").** The Overlay harmonic selector gains
  **`Harmonics 1, 3, 5 (odd only)`**. It is a **filter over the existing series**, not a second
  series: `notePartials(midis, nHarm, a4, oddOnly)` skips even `harm` and every partial it
  emits still carries its true harmonic number, so `partialLabel()` still prints `E2 ×5 ≈ G♯4`,
  `partialClusters()` still reads the same ratios and `_sgTrackAt()` still hit-tests the same
  question. Parsing lives in **one door**, `setSgHarm(v)` — the select, the `?sgharm=` hook and
  the status chip cannot disagree about what was drawn — and the chip prints `sgHarmLabel()`,
  which enumerates the harmonics (`harmonics 1, 3, 5 (odd only)`) rather than claiming a range
  it does not draw. `state.sgHarmOdd` is view state like every other overlay key: unpersisted,
  unexported, not in the refine cache key. **No physics claim was added** — docs/THEORY.md says
  nothing about odd-harmonic spectra, so the tooltip describes the control and stops (house
  rule: flag the gap, don't improvise). *Verification, in proportion:* `tests/r5.test.js`
  324 → **330** (3 block-0 math + 3 source-read, all mutation-checked — one caught a caller
  that read `state.sgHarm` without the flag), no new suite, no new `verify.sh` step, and the
  existing `?sgchord=E` shape re-run once through real Chrome (`data-sgcomb` 36 → **18**, chip
  reads `E · harmonics 1, 3, 5 (odd only)`, no ×2/×4 label anywhere).
- **Guitar names BUILT (session 32, reviewer; user request, "without much testing").** The
  letter chip's popover — already the slot's identity control — gains a name field. Five helpers
  in block 4 are the **one door** onto what a guitar is called: `slotName` (raw), `slotLabel`
  (name else letter), `slotDesc(i,max)` (name else short file name — the sites that printed the
  file *as* the identity), `slotFull(i,max)` (name else `A · file`) and `slotBtn` (a 12-char clip
  for the audition/play buttons). Every former `SLOT_LETTER[i]`/`shortName(s.name)` identity site
  routes through one: cards, per-card A/B key, verdict, band headers, tone prose, all four line-plot
  legends, sgram/envelope titles, crosshair readouts, EQ legend + "Copy settings", status/footer
  lines, the PNG header and the CSV comment block. **A name is identity, not viewer preference, so
  it is NOT in `gsSettings`** (unlike `gsColors`, which is per theme): it rides in the snapshot as
  `settings.slotNames` **and** a `label` per file entry, restored settings-first; persisting it
  would re-attach last session's name to the next dropped file, so `clearSlot()` and
  `loadFileIntoSlot()` drop it — a recorded take keeps it. `setSlotName()` is the only writer
  (card + A/B key + tables + canvases); because `renderCard` replaces the chip the popover anchors
  to *and* closes the popover for that reason, it re-opens on the new chip via the extracted
  `anchorColorPop()`, and `openColorPop` no longer reassigns the input's value when it matches
  (caret would jump to the end each keystroke). **Renaming is in place** (user request 2026-09-05,
  after rejecting a popover door): the card always prints a `.slotname` — the name, or a muted
  italic *Guitar A* placeholder (`.unset`) so an unnamed guitar has something to click — and
  `beginRename(i)` swaps it for a `.slotname-edit` text field where it sits; Enter or blur
  commits through `setSlotName()` (still the one writer), Esc restores the span, and `renderCard`
  rebuilds the head either way so the editor is never torn down by hand. The chip's popover keeps
  its name field. Its local is named `field`, not `inp` — `tests/r5.test.js` pins the *first*
  `inp.addEventListener` in the source to the triad picker. *Verification, in proportion:* `node --check` ×5,
  the five node suites (only the documented `dsp` red), `?demo&open=all` in real Chrome with both
  guitars named, the popover in both themes, and an in-page snapshot round-trip.
- **Tone character REWORKED (session 33, user request; audit → proposal approved on all five
  calls → built).** The ten descriptors conflated instrument, performance and recording; the
  audit on the user's three takes (docs/THEORY.md §7, `node tests/audit_tone.js`) found **none**
  of them moves less with the phrase than with the guitar, and the Majesty's sustained note was a
  ×3 sub-harmonic at 0.84 confidence. Now **three groups**: *Instrument* (pickup voice / body voice
  by slot type, string stiffness B, overtone ring, bloom, sustain across the neck — the only rows
  that feed At a glance), *Voicing / technique* (brightness with tilt under it, even/odd, richness,
  warmth, fullness, attack, attack colour, tightness, sustain band, dynamic range), *Take /
  recording* (pitch check, level and floor, between notes, material). Nothing dropped. Every row
  has a **reliability band** — provisional from the audit until the **repeatability mode** ("Same
  guitar, two takes" → Save as bands, `gsSettings` **v5**) measures the user's own — and |Δ| inside
  it prints "not distinguishable". A **comparability bar** greys rows a mismatched register /
  density / onset count / floor / duration / level would poison. **Pitch comb check**
  (`combCheckF0`: ×1/×2/×3, lowest with teeth 1–6 present, never lowered) gates every
  harmonic-indexed number. **Instrument type per card is back** (Solidbody / Hollow or acoustic —
  it now selects what is measured; cross-type pairs are never differenced). Centroids carry no
  note name. Exports are schema `tone-2` (additive). Details: SPEC.md 2026-09-05, ARCHITECTURE
  "Tone character rework", THEORY §7.6 for every derivation. Awaiting the user's visual test.
- **E phase — evidence-driven readouts — STARTED (session 34, 2026-09-05).** Process fixes
  committed first (`P — process`: the no-Chrome-outside-a-gate house rule above,
  `./tests/verify.sh --node`, `HEADLESS_TRIES`, effort per role), then **E0 recorded**: the
  three principles (usability / UX / audience), the decisions (four render states per row,
  verdicts only from measured bands, rows dropped or moved, a slot holds takes, three-valued
  type, Band Energy folded into the plots, Regions control in the strip, the three-rung
  language ladder, optional guided recording, the name written into saved audio) and the row
  disposition table — SPEC.md 2026-09-05 (E phase) and docs/ROADMAP.md `# E — evidence-driven
  readouts`; THEORY §7.7 is a placeholder E1.1 fills with measured numbers. Three reversals
  of T are named there. **E1 next** (gate), then E2 (gate), E3–E5 (batch), E6 (gate), E7
  (gate). Stop at each gate for the user's test.
- **E1 BUILT (session 34, reviewer) — gate 8 run; awaiting the user's visual test.** The tone
  panel says how sure it is: `TONE_EVIDENCE` / `toneEvidenceOf` / `evidenceFor` /
  `toneRowState` in block 0 (measured on the audit takes first — THEORY §7.7: Pickup voice
  20/40 → 10/35, Bloom 10 → 4, "≥ 4 strings" proxied by span, **brightness-in-note-bodies
  rejected** because the floor sensitivity rises); four render states (solid + shaded band +
  verdict / solid / hollow / collapsed to one `missingPhrase()` line); **a verdict only from a
  band measured on the user's own takes** — `diff`/`same` assigned once each inside the
  measured guard; a provisional band decides hollow-vs-solid and nothing else; Warmth /
  Fullness / Tightness / Sustain (band) gone, Attack folded, Dynamic range in Take, Fundamental
  decay added, String stiffness open E/A only with plain words and never in At a glance, Body
  voice hidden for a solidbody pair; rung-3 detail lives in the readout popover
  (`openTonePop`, click a value); At a glance reads state-1 rows and otherwise names the
  cheapest upgrade; exports `tone-3`. **Verified first:** the bandlimited
  `rameau_Take-00-58-04.wav` is the source (an all-digital, cab-simulated feed), not the capture
  — the app now records `track.getSettings()`'s processing flags on the take and warns if any
  was on. Gate hooks `?load=` (debug), `?tuning=`, `?pop=tone.<row>.<slot>`. `tests/e.test.js`
  is the E-phase suite (**134** after E5), verify.sh step 6 of 8.
- **E2 BUILT (session 34, branch `e-phase`; the user asked for E2–E7 on one branch without
  stopping at each gate).** A slot holds takes: `state.slots[i]` stays take 0, siblings in a
  non-enumerable shared `takes` array (`slotTakes(i)` the door); drop/record/"+ Add take" append
  and keep the name; snapshot `files[i].takes[]` additive with `snapshotTakeRecords()` the one
  reader (v1 → one record); `toneBandsFromTakes()` + `liveToneBands()` make measured bands when
  **both** slots hold ≥ 2 takes (live → saved → provisional), the "Same guitar, two takes" switch
  is app-set and disabled; the card has the name as headline, a take list with a readiness dot
  per take (`takeReadiness` over `evidenceFor`), one Play/Pause, a canvas waveform seeking
  through `seekCard()`. `tests/e.test.js` **104**.
- **E3 + E4 + E5 BUILT (session 34, branch `e-phase`, one gate for the batch).** **E3:**
  `REC_PROTOCOL` (six steps, `unlocks` validated against `TONE_EVIDENCE` at load) drives a
  guided take on M5's capture — prompts advance on onsets counted by the analysis's own
  `stftBands → detectOnsets` from the capture's existing tick, a first played step under 40 dB
  above the measured floor stops the take, `protocol:{version,stepsDone,skipped,floorDb}` rides
  in the take's facts; the `Guided` switch (`state.recGuided`, additive in gsSettings) off is
  byte-identical to M5. **E4:** the Band Energy table is gone — `bandRowsFor()`/`bandTable()` is
  the one builder; shares print under each region on the Spectrum strip, Δ under each region and
  a band-mean **step line** (faint + dashed `[4,4]` where the whole band is under the floor) on
  the Difference; a region's popover row carries range/shares/Δ/floor; Bands CSV/JSON under the
  Spectrum exports; `None` vocabulary; the vocabulary **chip** is the strip's first row on both
  plots (its own row — an inline chip hid the 60–100 Hz label); Strings + Clear harmonics on the
  x-axis row; the Frequency card header is title and subtitle only; `gsCollapse`/`?open=` drop
  `bands`. **E5:** rung-1 words on every surface (SPEC has the moved-strings table); Take rows
  are a light and a phrase; every value/phrase is the same `[data-pop]` tap. **E5.4 taste call
  presented, not decided:** default vocabulary Band mix vs EQ speak (or None). **E6 next.**
- **NEXT — E3 → E7 on `e-phase`, then the user’s test of the whole branch.** (Older note follows.) R5 is closed; Q4a and Q4b are built, so nothing stands
  between here and R6. (Tasks + gates in
  docs/ROADMAP.md — start at its **Milestones at a glance** table; specs in docs/STORY.md, math
  in docs/THEORY.md.) M3/M4 remain gated on explicit user go-ahead.
  **R5.4 (bound the overlay in time) is no longer part of R5** — the user moved it into R6 as
  **R6.4** on 2026-08-26, so R5 closed with R5.5.
  R5.1/R5.2/R5.6/R5.3/R5.7/Q1/Q2/R5.5/Q3/Q4a/Q4b are all built and awaiting the user's visual test. **R6** is the old R5 — interval consonance
  explainers (joint period, comb alignment, Plomp–Levelt roughness) — still blocked until
  the user resolves the two docs/THEORY.md §2.5 numeric caveats (R6.4 is not blocked: it is
  plumbing, not physics). Educational tone: measure
  first, never lecture — curiosity clicks the ✦. **Delegation shape, proven at gates 3, 4
  and 7: write the physics copy myself, freeze it by sentinel + SHA, hand the builder only
  the plumbing (Sonnet — via exec for milestones, sub-agents for small tweaks per 2026-08-26).**
- The gate: `./tests/verify.sh` — dsp **216**, r3 42, r4 60, m27 51, r5 **332**, **e 134**, headless **73**
  (eight steps since E1; `--node` skips the headless step).
  **Step 1 is red on master and has been since `ac65835` "EQ match: fit
  each band inside its neighbours, in increasing frequency"** — the single-peak recovery bound
  `ok(mx < 1.0)` at [tests/dsp.test.js:547](tests/dsp.test.js#L547) went 0.999 → 1.022 dB there
  (bisected; every commit before it passes, every one after fails). Block-0 EQ math, unrelated to
  any later work; awaiting the user's call on fitting vs. re-justifying the bound. Steps 2–7 and
  all four tamper guards (`tests/` untouched, all three frozen copy SHAs) are green.
  `tests/dsp.test.js` includes the M2.6e switch CSS contract and the R1.3
  snapshot back-compat guard, extracted from `index.html` and mutation-checked. Demo pair verified end-to-end
  against a numeric probe of the full pipeline; every view since M2 verified by headless
  `?demo` screenshots in both themes (EQ device faces, single-guitar, magnify, all four
  vocabulary lanes, zoomed panes, custom guitar colors incl. the recolored difference
  colormap, verdict strip, audition popovers, folded/unfolded cards) plus
  pixel-regression compares against prior commits at each step. UI state machines
  (audition html, card play, EQ text export, disclosure) have node tests that extract
  the real functions from index.html — see the scratchpad pattern in ARCHITECTURE.md.
  M2.6e adds a CSS-contract check in `tests/dsp.test.js` (same `index.html` read)
  so the switch on-state cannot silently revert to the dark pill or guitar colors.

## File map

- `index.html` — the entire app, the only shipped artifact. No build step, no server, no
  network. Six `<script>` tags: the DNT-aware GA4 visitor tag in `<head>` (inert offline,
  touches no app state), then five numbered blocks in dependency order: **0** DSP (pure functions, node-safe — tests
  import this block by extraction), **1** audio decode/sniffing glue, **2** glossary data
  + popovers, **3** canvas rendering, **4** app state/UI/synth/exports.
- `tests/dsp.test.js` — extracts script block 0 from index.html, runs it under node.
  No framework; prints `N passed, M failed`, exit code 1 on failure.
- `tests/verify.sh` — **the Rameau gate** (R3, then R4, then M2.7, then R5); the one command a delegated
  builder must get to exit 0 before opening a PR. Runs the five node suites plus
  `tests/headless.js` and the untouched-`tests/` and frozen-copy guards; `BASE=<ref>` picks the comparison base (default `master`).
- `tests/r3.test.js` — the R3 suite: `findCoincidences()` math and the R3.2–R3.4 wiring
  contracts, all read out of `index.html`. `tests/r4.test.js` — the same shape for R4:
  `stringAncestry()`/`isPow2` math plus the R4.1–R4.4 wiring contracts and the frozen
  ancestry-copy SHA. `tests/m27.test.js` — the M2.7 suite: `sgramWindowFor()` math, the
  M2.7.1–M2.7.4 wiring contracts, and the guard that ARCHITECTURE.md's "zoom is a crop"
  bullet was rewritten and SPEC.md appended (docs the code contradicts are a gate failure).
  `tests/r5.test.js` — the R5 suite: `notePartials()`/`partialClusters()` math, the
  consistency assertion binding every `findCoincidences()` landing to some cluster, and the
  R5.1 wiring contracts — including the one that the note set handed to `notePartials()` is
  **string-indexed, not the single selected note** (`key` picks the hue).
- `tests/headless.js` — differential pixel + DOM checks through real Chrome. Note two
  traps recorded in ARCHITECTURE: `--user-data-dir` makes headless Chrome hang forever
  in first-run setup, and `index.html` carries its own source inline, so `--dump-dom`
  contains every string literal — scope copy assertions to the target element.
- `tests/png.js` — dependency-free PNG decode / pixel diff / blob clustering (node
  `zlib` only), used by `headless.js`.
- `tests/audit_tone.js` — the tone-panel audit (THEORY §7), a tool not a gate step: runs the
  shipped block-0 descriptors on `samples/{Les_Paul,SG,Majesty}.wav` and prints every number
  quoted in the confounder table.
- `tests/make_samples.js` — regenerates `samples/*.wav` (deterministic Karplus–Strong,
  same seeds/math as the in-app demo — the two must stay in lockstep), then verifies the
  app's own sniffer reads the rates back.
- `samples/demo-bright-44k.wav`, `samples/demo-warm-48k.wav` — drag-drop test material.
- `SPEC.md` — verbatim prompt + decision changelog. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — DSP
  pipeline, parameter rationale, browser quirks, dead ends.
- `docs/STORY.md` — the app's identity: name/slogan origin, the About-section text,
  and the educational product direction (discovery moments, ancestry views,
  consonance explainers). Read before user-facing copy.
- `docs/THEORY.md` — the verified physics/math source (harmonic series, roughness
  §2.5, consonance §2.6, denominator rule §3.4, narrative §3.6, dynasty of
  fifths/Tonnetz §3.7, Rameau appendix) — ground truth for all educational features.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — the Rameau phase (R1 rename, R2 About modal, R3 ✦ discovery
  moments, R4 ancestry, M2.7 resolution-follows-attention, R5 harmonic tracks,
  R6 consonance) split into individually buildable, testable,
  commit-sized tasks with file anchors and done-when criteria. Read before starting
  any Rameau-phase work; update the task's status there when it lands. Its "Working
  discipline" section is the scope contract for anyone (human or model) building these
  tasks — smallest diff, no unrequested refactors/UI/deps, flag rather than improvise.

## Run / test

- Open `index.html` in a browser. `?demo` auto-loads the built-in demo pair
  (`?demo=a`/`=b` loads one side only). Other test hooks: `?theme=bright|dark`,
  `?sgalign=file|onset`, `?mag=<viewkey>`, `?guide`,
  `?zoom=key:x0,x1[,y0,y1]` (key = spec|diff|env|eqresp|sga|sgb; data units —
  sg keys take x in display-time seconds, y in Hz), `?vocab=eq|anatomy|solo|mix|none`
  (annotation-lane vocabulary), `?ca=RRGGBB`/`?cb=RRGGBB` (session-only guitar-color
  overrides), `?open=all|key,key` (unfold collapsed panels: diff|bands|tone|eq|sgram|
  env — **full-page screenshots need `?open=all`** now that eq/sgram/env start
  folded), `?pop=<glosskey>` (pin a glossary/region popover open for capture; `?pop=coin<N>` pins
  the Nth ✦ coincidence popover, N indexing the sorted `findCoincidences()` result;
  `?pop=str<N>` pins the open-string popover for string N = 0–5, low E first;
  `?pop=clu<N>` pins the Nth collision-cluster popover of the current overlay),
  `?tol=<0-50>` (coincidence tolerance in cents — **gate hook only**, unpersisted, no UI),
  `?refine=0` (disable M2.7's zoom refinement, restoring the crop-only spectrogram —
  **gate hook only**, unpersisted, no UI; each sgram pane canvas also carries
  `data-sgwin="<window>"`, the window that pane actually rendered, for the same reason:
  the canvas is unreachable from node),
  `?sgnote=<all|0-5>` (spectrogram harmonic overlay: pick one open string, or `all` for every
  open string; out of range selects nothing — and **nothing is the default**, R5.7), `?sgchord=<name>` (one of the eight stocked open chords — `E|Em|A|Am|C|D|Dm|G`;
  an unstocked name overlays nothing, because the hook mutes all six strings before it
  resolves) and `?sgharm=<n>` (harmonics 1–N, clamped 1–16; `?sgharm=odd<n>` — e.g. `odd5` —
  draws only the **odd** harmonics 1, 3, 5 … up to N) 
  `?sgtriadonly=<0|1>` (draw only the chord's root, third and fifth — it *does* have a
  checkbox in the Overlay group, the hook exists so the gate can set it) — **gate hooks only**,
  unpersisted; each sgram pane canvas carries `data-sgcomb="<count>"`, the number of partial
  tracks in that pane's overlay (sounding strings × the harmonics the limit admits), absent
  when the overlay is off,
  `?sgscrim=<0-90>` / `?sgdim=<0-95>` (R5.6's scrim opacity and unfocused-comb dimming, as
  percentages — these *do* have UI ranges in the sgram card head; the hooks exist so the gate
  can set them) and `?sgfocus=<0-5>` (hold one string's comb without a mouse; out of range
  holds nothing) — unpersisted, never exported; panes also carry `data-sglabels="<count>"`
  (harmonic labels actually drawn, after the 12 px overlap guard), `data-sgfocus="<si>"`
  (the comb being held) and `data-sgclusters="<count>"` (R5.3 collision marks actually
  **drawn**, after the x-stride thinner — not the number of clusters found), all absent
  when there is nothing to report,
  `?sgcmap=<parula|viridis|cividis|magma|inferno>`,
  `?sgtrack=<white|black|yellow|red|triad>`,
  `?sgdash=<dash|dot|fine|solid>` (default **dash** since R5.7), `?sghue=<0|1>` (R5.7's
  String-hues modifier) and `?sgtriad=<RRGGBB,RRGGBB,RRGGBB>` (the three Triad colors, root
  first; each validated
  against its own table, an unknown name falling back to the default — these *do* have UI
  controls in the sgram card head, the hooks exist so the gate can set them); every drawn
  pane carries `data-sgcmap` and, when a comb exists, `data-sgtrack`,
  the LTAS Difference canvas carries `data-nearfloor="<count>"` — grid points drawn as
  "both curves below the floor" (R5.5), absent when there are none (again: node cannot read a
  canvas) — and the Band Energy table carries `data-nearfloor-rows="<count>"`, the rows whose
  whole band sits under that floor (Q3), absent by the same convention,
  `?load=<rel>[,<rel>]` (**with `?debug` only**: fetch one or two audio files by a path
  relative to `index.html` and land them as A/B — headless needs
  `--allow-file-access-from-files`; how the gate renders the real audit takes),
  `?tuning=estd|eb|dstd|dropd|dadgad` (session-only, never saved), `?pop=tone.<row>.<slot>`
  (the E1 readout popover of a tone row, slot 0/1), `?vocab=none` (E4.5 — the empty
  vocabulary; both frequency canvases carry `data-regions="<n>"`, absent for None, and the
  Difference canvas carries `data-nearfloor-rows` since E4.2),
  `?strings=1|0` (bottom-axis open-string labels), `?harmonics=0|1` (compat hook —
  `1` turns harmonics 2–4 on for every string), `?how` (open the "How to use this
  app" walkthrough), `?about` (open the About modal), `?debug` (reveal the hidden
  "Load test files" button). `samples/Les_Paul.wav`, `samples/SG.wav`, `samples/Majesty.wav` are the
  user's real takes (one riff, then the six open strings in E♭ standard) — set the tuning to E♭
  so the Instrument rows read the open strings.
- `node tests/dsp.test.js` — full DSP suite. `node tests/make_samples.js` — regenerate WAVs.
- `./tests/verify.sh` — the Rameau gate (all suites + tamper guards; seven steps as of R5).
  **Green as of gate 7**; keep it that way, and reuse its shape (frozen copy + read-only
  `tests/`) for R5.2 on.
  **It must not run inside a shell sandbox** — Chrome aborts at startup in
  `_RegisterApplication` (exit 134) when it cannot reach `launchservicesd`, and macOS
  pops a crash dialog per launch. `tests/headless.js` recognises that abort, prints the
  cause and the fix, and stops on the first one. Delegated milestone builds launch as
  `/usr/local/bin/muse exec --disable-sandbox --prompt-file docs/handoff/spark-<task>.md`
  (add `--disable-approval` unattended, `-w create` for a worktree). Small instrument tweaks
  (R5.1a, the 2026-08-25 sgram-diff removal, R5.5 near-floor disclosure) delegate instead via
  in-session Sonnet sub-agents per 2026-08-26 — same gate, `tests/` still read-only. Never point `$CHROME`
  at a stub to get past it: a gate step that cannot run is red.
- Headless screenshot (virtual time fast-forwards the Welch yields):
  `"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --headless=new
  --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars --window-size=1440,2900 --virtual-time-budget=30000
  --screenshot=out.png "file:///…/index.html?demo"` — use `?demo&open=all` and a
  taller window (≈4600) to capture the panels that start folded.

## House rules

- **Never launch headless Chrome unless the current task names a headless assertion.
  `./tests/verify.sh` runs once per milestone, at the gate, by the reviewer. A pure-UI task
  ships on `node --check` on all five blocks and a read-through; a copy or CSS change ships
  on that alone. A small request that says 'no gate' means no Chrome and no new assertion.**
  Between tasks, `./tests/verify.sh --node` (the five node suites + tamper guards, seconds,
  never prints `gate passed`). Recorded 2026-09-05 as process fix P1; the reasoning is in
  docs/ROADMAP.md "Verification, in proportion".
- **Sample rate is read from file bytes, never asked of the user.** Decode via
  OfflineAudioContext at the file's native rate; each file's own rate in its frequency
  math; refuse files whose rate can't be determined. "Facts come from the data, intent
  comes from the user" — tuning and A4 are user-set, never guessed from the audio.
  **There is no instrument (electric/acoustic) selector** — it was removed at v1.0.0
  because it changed nothing in the analysis (see ARCHITECTURE.md "Why instrument mode
  was removed"); acoustic body resonances are still measured and reported in the
  glossary, and acoustic mic technique lives in the recording guide.
- **A recording is a source, not a mode.** `● Record…` captures raw Float32 PCM through
  the Web Audio graph and lands it via `finishSlotFromBuffer()` exactly as a dropped file
  lands — never `MediaRecorder`, never a codec, never a resample. The take's rate is the
  capture context's rate, which is data like any file's rate. **Channel count is observed,
  never asked**: probe with a discrete 32-channel node and believe only non-zero samples
  (`n = max(heard, claimed, 1)`); a device's own claim may be silently wrong, and silence
  proves nothing — so offer a re-check rather than a final answer. **The picker lists the
  channels the probe heard, and the browser's limit is stated in words** (user request
  2026-09-04, reversing an all-32 list built earlier the same day): a probe that heard two
  channels is evidence about the 700 ms it listened to, but 32 options of which 30 return
  digital silence is a promise the browser does not keep, so the unprovable half is said in
  a sentence — an always-present warning that a browser opens only some devices and hands
  the page only a few of their channels (macOS Chrome and Safari: the first two, whatever
  the device carries), naming the routes that work (Aggregate Device ordering, or a DAW and
  a dropped file). A remembered pick above the list is dropped to *All channels* by
  `clampRecChannel()`. The other half of the same honesty: a take that is **entirely
  zero samples is refused, not landed** — hard zero is the platform saying the channel
  never arrived, and an unmeasurable silence must not reach `finishSlotFromBuffer()`
  looking like a recording. Nothing leaves the
  machine: a take stays in the page, like every file dropped on it. No realtime analysis —
  that is M3, still gated.
  **The panel meters the level before the take, not only during it** — from the walk
  `onaudioprocess` already did for `cap.heard`, never a second pass or an added node: bar
  linear in dBFS over −60..0, fill RMS, rider a 1 s peak hold at −12 dB/s, drained by a
  100 ms tick. As soon as the device and channel are known the panel opens a **pre-roll
  monitor** — `_startCapture`'s graph with the recorder removed (no chunks, no total, no
  `t0`; `paintLevel()` reads the missing `t0` to know it must not write the elapsed clock) —
  because a meter that only lives during capture arrives after the moment it exists to
  prevent. **One device, one owner:** monitor and capture are mutually exclusive and every
  exit door calls `stopMonitor()`; a monitor that cannot open **reports nothing**, since
  *Start recording* opens the same device and surfaces the same failure. The face is Logic's
  — one green→amber→red gradient painted across the whole track and **revealed** by
  `clip-path`, so the zone belongs to the dB and not to the fill length, with the −12 dB
  target marked on the bar and said once in words beside it (the same target the recording
  guide names). **This reverses the "no green token" rule above:** meter hues are a data
  palette, identical in both themes, and green→red is what a player already reads.
- **Every visible number defensible.** Analysis params live in the footer; smoothing
  state is always printed on the plot; dB re full-scale sine everywhere; glossary terms
  link each label to its formula with current values.
- **The tone panel reports the guitar, and says how sure it is — by shape, not by sentence
  (E1).** Every row declares its evidence in `TONE_EVIDENCE` and renders in one of four states:
  banded (solid dots, shaded band, verdict — only from a band measured on the user's own takes),
  measured (solid, no band, no verdict), partial (hollow), not measurable (title plus one
  `missingPhrase()` line, which is also the instruction for next time). A provisional band never
  makes a verdict; it only decides hollow vs solid. Thresholds are measured on the audit takes
  before they become constants (THEORY §7.7). Rung-3 detail lives in the readout popover, never
  beside the dots. Three groups (Instrument /
  Voicing / Take); only state-1 Instrument rows reach At a glance; "not distinguishable" is said
  only inside a measured band; harmonic-indexed numbers exist only for notes that
  pass the comb check (`combCheckF0`) — a blank with a reason beats a confident wrong number; a
  spectral centroid is never spelled as a note. Instrument type is per card and asked, never
  inferred; a solidbody's resonant signature is its pickup hump, a hollow body's is its air
  resonance, and the two are never differenced. New descriptors need their derivation in
  docs/THEORY.md §7.6 before they appear.
- **Identity & education.** The app is **Claude Rameau**; the slogan *"Yes — but why
  does it sound that way?"* sits beside the title. Educational features teach the way
  the app's own origin did (docs/STORY.md): the instrument surfaces a curiosity
  marker (✦), the user clicks, the physics answers — measure first, never lecture.
  Every educational sentence must trace to docs/THEORY.md; if THEORY.md doesn't
  cover a claim, flag the gap to the user instead of improvising physics.
- **Design brief:** laboratory instrument built by a luthier. Two themes, **Bright
  (cream) is the default**, Dark is the original look; one accent per guitar per theme
  (Dark: A amber `#f0a13e`, B teal `#44c2d4`; Bright: A `#c05f04`, B `#0c6e80`),
  **user-overridable per theme** by clicking a loaded card's letter chip (localStorage
  `gsColors`, applied as inline `--slot-a/--slot-b`; snapshots deliberately don't carry
  colors — viewer preference, not analysis state). Tabular numerals, no
  chartjunk/3D/glow, 150–250 ms non-bouncy transitions. **Every plot names both axes** —
  quantity then unit in parentheses, through the one `drawAxisTitles()` helper (Q6), never a
  bare unit. All plot chrome routes through
  CSS vars (`cssColor`/`cssRGBA`); **data colormaps never theme** — the magma
  spectrogram (never rainbow) and the diverging difference stay dark scope-screens in
  both themes. The diverging endpoints default to amber/teal and follow user-picked
  guitar colors after a luminance lift (see ARCHITECTURE.md) — a user-identity change,
  not a theme change. Checked `.switch` tracks fill `--switch-on` with a `--switch-knob`
  (paper-light in both themes); never `--slot-a/--slot-b` — those would imply the
  control belongs to one guitar.
- **DSP params:** Welch LTAS 8192-pt Hann 50 % overlap; log grid 60 Hz–20 kHz (700 pts);
  metrics integrate 60 Hz–20 kHz only; octave smoothing off/1-12/1-6/1-3; peak detection
  always on 1/6-oct curve. Spectrogram 2048-pt Hann, 256 log cells 60 Hz–20 kHz,
  **max-pooled per cell** (never mean — see ARCHITECTURE.md), shared A/B color scale,
  drawn in one of **five** perceptual colormaps (`CMAP_HEX`, selector order = `CMAP_NAMES`:
  **parula — the default** — viridis, cividis, magma, inferno; `state.sgCmap`, named on the
  status chip; `_CMAPS` stays pre-seeded with `MAGMA`, so magma is byte-identical and free). Like every data
  palette they **never theme**: the map is the user's choice, not the theme's;
  individual panes get
  a Free / File-time / First-onset time-axis choice; envelope overlay
  aligned at each file's first onset. **One global Level-match switch** (header
  Comparison field, M2.6a) drives plots, band table, verdict, spectrogram cells +
  shared scale, and playback gain; it **auto-latches on when both slots fill** — an
  explicit user flip this session is never overridden, snapshots pre-prime the latch
  (old snapshots' `sgLm` arms it too), dropping to one source re-arms it. Difference
  views have no toggle — they exist whenever two sources do (fold the card to
  dismiss). **Near-floor disclosure (R5.5):** the Difference Δ is never rewritten, but where
  **both** curves sit under `nearFloorDb()` — the *looser* of −60 dBFS and peak − 45 dB, peak
  scanned across both curves — that run draws faint (fill 0.06, line alpha 0.40) and dashed
  `[4,4]`, and the status chip names the floor it used. Runs shorter than
  `NEARFLOOR_MIN_RUN = 4` grid points are dropped **in the predicate**: a lone bin under the
  floor between audible neighbours is a notch, not silence. A large Δ where both curves are on
  the floor is a difference of silences — the Difference is a log-ratio, the Band Energy share
  is a power integral, and the plot says which one it is showing. **Q3 carries the same floor
  into the other two cards, through one shared predicate** (`nearFloorBands()`, reading
  `displayedDb`, marking a band only when *every* grid point in it is masked — one predicate,
  never two): a floored Band Energy row prints its Δ in `.delta-floor` with a `title=` and a
  footnote naming the floor (`data-nearfloor-rows`), and the "At a glance" strip headlines the
  widest **audible** gap only, giving any larger floored Δ its own disclosing sentence. `fmtPct`
  prints `< 0.1 %` rather than rounding a real share to `0.0 %`. No Δ is ever rewritten. Both line plots print the status chip (smoothing · level-match · zoom);
  the header Regions field holds the vocabulary selector. **Strings axis (M2.6b):**
  header toggle (default off, `gsStrings`, "S" key) draws open-string fundamentals as
  dotted verticals labeled on the **bottom** axis of both frequency line plots; labels
  click to a per-string docs popover (ET formula, harmonics up to the **8th**, per-string
  **Line color**, ±1/6-oct audition). A string draws **solid**, its shown harmonics **dashed
  in the same hue**; the hue comes from `_stringHex(si)` — `state.stringColors` if the user
  set one, `STRING_COLORS` otherwise — and persists in `gsSettings` **v4**. Peak/annotation
  markers are still dots-only click targets and the glossary values print Hz + nearest note,
  but harmonic verticals now **do** carry text (batch c): `partialLabel()`, the spectrogram’s
  own wording, rotated −90° at the bottom axis and skipped within 11 px. (The sgram's right-edge string-marker
  pass was **deleted at R5.7** — open strings appear there only when overlaid.) **Region-boundary Hz labels (M2.6c):** the lane
  prints each region's start/end frequency directly below its ticks (per lane row,
  compact axis format; full precision stays in the region's glossary popover);
  labels sort by x, shared edges print once, and any label that would touch its
  neighbor is skipped rather than smeared. The lane is taller only for two-row
  vocabularies (PLOT.mT 34 vs 48, kept in step by `syncLaneHeight()` from the
  `setVocab()` choke point — PLOT.mT is dynamic, never cache it). EQ match: least-squares fit of RBJ
  analog-magnitude band models against the **1/6-oct-smoothed** difference (never the
  raw comb) on 140 log points; device trim absorbs the broadband level gap; "Copy
  settings" exports the same `eqFitData()` as plain text. The annotation lane
  (`VOCABS` in block 3: EQ speak / Anatomy / Solo EQ / **Band mix, the default** —
  persisted via localStorage `gsVocab` written only on explicit clicks, with a one-time
  `gsVocabMig` migration clearing a stored pre-flip "eq") **drives the spectrum AND
  Difference-plot shading and the Band Energy table rows** (roles color-coded
  cut/keep/other; Anatomy bounds are tuning-reactive via
  `VOCAB_TUNING`/`syncVocabTuning()`); the tone-character panel keeps its own fixed
  physical bands regardless of lane. All lane regions are click-to-glossary; new
  glossary categories must be appended to `GLOSS_CATS` or their entries won't render.
  The "At a glance" verdict strip reuses the Band-Energy math and the tone panel's
  `proseCandidates()` verbatim so summary and detail can never disagree; every candidate
  declares `fam:"tone"`/`fam:"time"` and the strip prints its leader **plus the strongest
  sentence of the other family** (Q5) — the ranking itself is never re-weighted, because the
  tone panel reads the same list. Playback
  (region audition buttons in popovers; per-card Play) always sources the **analyzed
  mono mix** — never the original file — with level-match gain on B when active
  (printed on the card button); region audition band-passes with a 4th-order
  Butterworth. One playback at a time; stops on popover close, data change, lm
  toggle, Esc, or natural end.
  **Each card carries one transport row** — play/stop, pause, a native `accent-color` seek
  slider, elapsed/duration, and ● Record — while ⟳ Replace and ✕ Clear stay in `.fileacts`:
  the transport is what makes sound, `.fileacts` is what manages the slot. A source node cannot
  resume, so pause is stop-plus-a-remembered-offset and seek is a restart at
  `startPlayback(…, off)` (`off` appended **last**, so region audition is unchanged); position
  is read from `playCtx.currentTime`, never counted by the paint timer. **Stop resets the
  slider because every stop path shares one `onstop`** — `cardPlayStopped` zeroes the position
  unless `playKeepPos` is up, which only pause and seek raise; never enumerate stop sources in
  the UI layer.
  Progressive disclosure: diff/bands/tone/eq/sgram/env fold to their header chevron
  (verdict + spectrum never fold; **eq/sgram/env start folded**); folded panels skip
  model + canvas work in `drawAll()`; localStorage `gsCollapse` stores only
  explicitly-clicked panels; snapshots don't carry fold state.
  Plot zoom (line plots **and** spectrogram panes) is **display-only** (`ZOOMS{}` in
  data units, baked in by the model builders, shared with the magnify overlay):
  metrics/band table/tone panel never read it, and the active window is always printed
  on the plot. **Sgram zoom refines (M2.7):** an x-zoomed pane re-runs the STFT over just
  that window at `sgramWindowFor(span, rate)` (up to 8192-pt, hop `win>>5`, `gridN:512`) and
  the pane says which window it drew — in the status chip, in the crosshair readout, and in
  `data-sgwin`. Refinement is per pane and lives inside `sgramModelFor` (cached on the slot),
  so the magnify overlay inherits it; an **unzoomed** pane still crops the base 2048-pt image
  and is pixel-identical to v1.0.0. A frequency-only zoom is still a crop — the window follows
  the **time** span. `drawAll()` stays synchronous; the finer pass swaps in when it lands.
  **Harmonic-track overlay (R5.1):** the sgram card's `Overlay` controls pick one open
  string and a harmonic limit into `state.sgFrets`/`state.sgHarm` — the spectrogram's **own**
  note state, deliberately separate from the frequency plots' Strings/harmonics, unpersisted,
  never exported, and **not part of the refine cache key**. The limit's last entry is
  **odd only** (`state.sgHarmOdd`, a fourth `oddOnly` argument to `notePartials()`): a
  *filter over the same series*, never a different series, so every partial it returns keeps
  its true `harm` number and the labels, clusters and hit test read unchanged. `sgramModelFor()` publishes the
  flat `notePartials()` array as `comb` (unclipped — the draw pass clips); a fourth pass in
  `drawSpectrogramScene()` draws each partial full-width at `yOfF(f)`: a 5 px black halo at
  alpha 0.75, then 2.5 px of `_trackColor(key)` — `STRING_COLORS[key]` lifted to 0.62 L,
  because a track is read against its own halo rather than the magma — solid fundamental /
  dashed `[6,4]` above. Panes are **372 px** tall (288 px narrow) so the log
  frequency axis is readable at all. Hand `notePartials()` the
  **six-slot** note array, never the one selected note — `key` is the index it was given and
  `key` picks the hue. The tracks are a **data** palette: identical in both themes. The app
  never detects which notes were played; the user names them (intent), the overlay predicts,
  the measurement judges. The harmonic-limit select is **disabled until a note is overlaid**
  (`syncSgHarmSel()`, called from every door into `state.sgFrets`). **PNG exports render the
  view as it stands (R5.1a)** — tracks, strings axis, ✦ and all; CSV/JSON stay data-only.
  **Chords + overlay legibility (R5.2/R5.6):** `SG_CHORDS` stocks eight open shapes as
  **fret** arrays, so a shape moves with the tuning. Because six combs interleave, each
  partial now carries a label — `partialLabel()` in block 0: `E2` for a fundamental,
  `E2 ×3 = B3` inside R3's locked tier, `E2 ×5 ≈ G♯4` outside it (the 5th harmonic really
  is 14 ¢ flat of the tempered note — the `≈` is the lesson, THEORY §1/§5). Labels draw
  highest-first and are **skipped, never smeared**, within 12 px. The draw order is
  image → **scrim** (`state.sgScrim`, default **0.10**, 0–90 % range, `?sgscrim=`) → chrome →
  tracks → labels: the sheet separates prediction from measurement and appears **only when
  a comb does**. Holding the mouse on a track sets `state.sgFocus` to its **string** (comb,
  not line) and dims every other comb to `1 − state.sgDim` (default **0.80**, 0–95 %,
  `?sgdim=`); a >3 px drag hands off to the zoom box. `sgScrim`/`sgDim`/`sgFocus` are view
  state like `sgFrets` — unpersisted, unexported, not in the refine cache key — and their
  ranges ship disabled until something is overlaid.
  **Collision marks (R5.3):** `partialClusters(comb, TEMPERED_CENTS)` — the R5.0 primitive,
  no new detector, no new tolerance — puts one `starPath()` mark per cluster on the pane, in
  fixed cream over a black halo (it belongs to neither string, and the magma is dark in both
  themes), **filled** inside R3's ±6 ¢ and **hollow** in the tempered tier. Marks spread
  along x, which carries no meaning here, so they thin by **x stride** rather than the
  labels' vertical guard. Clicking one opens `clusterRatio()`'s reading of the chord —
  fundamentals go as `1/h_i`, octave duplicates folded, named only where docs/THEORY.md
  fixes the ratio (`4:5:6`, `10:12:15`, five intervals) and left as a bare ratio otherwise.
  The two marks come with a **key** drawn above the plot (session 26): both stars again, as
  the pane draws them, each on an 18×18 chip of `cmapColor(cmap,.05)`, labelled from
  `COINCIDENCE_CENTS` — never a number typed into a caption. It lives in a dynamic top
  margin (`SG_MT_BASE 30 → SG_MT_KEY 52`, set before `pH` is derived) keyed off
  **`model.clusters`, the whole set** — `SGPLOT` is a singleton the crosshair reads live, so
  a per-pane margin would measure one pane against another's geometry.
  **Track color and dash (look pass, rewritten at R5.7):** `SG_TRACKS` is
  **White / Black / Bright yellow / Bright red / Triad** (Cyan and Magenta removed; the two
  bright colors added session 26) and `SG_DASHES` is
  **Dashes `[6,4]` — the default** / Dots `[2,4]` / Fine `[1,3]` / Solid; fundamentals are
  always solid. **String hues is a separate checkbox modifier** (`state.sgHue`, default
  **off**) that tints whichever color is chosen at a **0.30** mix (0.62 was replacement, not
  tint) — it was never a color of its own — and a
  **halo is drawn only under that modifier** (`halo = !!model.hue`), so a plain White or
  Black track is one 1.4 px stroke, which is the point of offering it. **Triad** paints
  root/third/fifth of the sounding chord (`triadDegrees()` in block 0) with every harmonic
  in its own note's color; its three pickers are `disabled` outside Triad and default to
  **white / bright yellow / bright red** — the palette the user named (session 26), replacing
  R5.7's measured pick. Min pairwise ΔE is still 97.0, but parula *ends* in bright yellow, so
  the third's track sits ΔE 2.8 from the hottest cells: a known cost, recorded in the gate's
  own comment rather than hidden behind a floor the palette no longer meets.
  **Triad only** (`state.sgTriadOnly`, a checkbox in the Overlay group) is the same idea one
  level up — a *filter over the notes*: `triadOnly()` in block 0 nulls every slot that is not
  the root, the third or the fifth of the sounding set (intervals 0, 3/4, 7 above the lowest
  note; a doubled degree keeps its lowest string), returning a **same-length** array so every
  surviving partial keeps its string index and its hue. It is a stricter sibling of
  `triadDegrees()`, never a reuse — that one colors every string and reassigns leftovers.
  **`sgSoundingMidis()` is the one door** onto the notes the overlay draws: the model, the hit
  test, the `?pop=clu` hook and `syncSgHarmSel()`'s focus clear all read it, so the pixels and
  the click targets cannot disagree.
  **Nothing is overlaid by default** — the note selector starts at `None` — and the harmonic
  labels sit **outside the plot** in the right margin, which `SGPLOT.mR` widens (98 → 150)
  whenever a comb exists. `sgCmap`/`sgTrack`/`sgDash`/`sgHue`/`sgTriad` are
  view state like `sgFrets`: unpersisted, unexported, and only the colormap is in the image
  cache key (`gkey` analysis + `cm`), never the line style.
- Keep `tests/make_samples.js` synth math identical to the in-app demo synth when
  editing either.
- Update SPEC.md changelog, this file, and ARCHITECTURE.md at milestone boundaries and
  after significant decisions, unprompted. Commit at each working state.
