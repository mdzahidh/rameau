# The Rameau gate (R3, R4, M2.7, R5, then the E phase). One command; exit 0 means the branch is reviewable.
#
# Run from the repo root:          ./tests/verify.sh
# Compare against another base:    BASE=origin/master ./tests/verify.sh
# Node suites + tamper guards only:  ./tests/verify.sh --node   (seconds; not the gate)
#
# Eight things must hold:
#   1. the existing DSP suite is still green   - no regression in shipped math
#   2. tests/r3.test.js is green               - the R3 wiring contracts are met
#   3. tests/r4.test.js is green               - the R4 wiring contracts are met
#   4. tests/m27.test.js is green              - the M2.7 wiring contracts are met
#   5. tests/r5.test.js is green               - the R5 wiring contracts are met
#   6. tests/e.test.js is green                - the E-phase contracts are met (2026-09-05 ->)
#   7. tests/headless.js is green              - it really renders and opens (skipped by --node)
#   8. the gate itself was not edited          - tests/ untouched, all three copies frozen
#
# (8) is what makes (1)-(7) mean anything: a builder who may edit the tests can
# always make them pass. The frozen copy blocks are educational prose already
# reviewed against docs/THEORY.md -- wiring them up is the task, rewriting them is not.
