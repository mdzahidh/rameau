// number. Rate is load-dependent: ~1 launch in 6 on an idle machine, 3 in 8 when a
// second Chrome is running alongside, and 7 in 8 with a runaway background process
// (measured against an unmodified checkout while spotlightknowledged held 99 % CPU at
// load average 5.7 — the same checkout missed 0 of 8 once it settled). At that rate no
// sane retry budget helps, so the harness names the condition rather than hiding it:
// see drawReport() below. Never answer a loaded machine by weakening a check.
// Both helpers below check that the page really
// drew and try again if it did not; after TRIES launches they hand back what they have,
// so the assertion fails loudly rather than passing against a blank page. Ten because
// the run has ~25 such sites and the miss rate is not a constant: at the ~1-in-6 of an
// idle machine six tries already left under 0.01 % per site, but at the 1-in-2 measured
// under load six tries leave 1.6 % per site — a third of all runs red on a build that is
// fine. Ten takes that to 0.1 % per site, ~2 % per run, and costs nothing when the first
// launch draws.
//
// Ask for the attribute the assertions actually read, not for the canvas width:
// drawAll() writes width and data-sgwin in the same branch, so an undrawn page has
// neither — but the overlay-off assertions check that data-sgcomb is *absent*, and a
// blank page supplies that for free. Anchoring readiness on data-sgwin closes that
// false pass.
//

// all-or-nothing: a gate run in which every pane-A assertion passed still failed twice
// on pane B, once for data-sgwin and once for data-sgcomb, because A had drawn and B
